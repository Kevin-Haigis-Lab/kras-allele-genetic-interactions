# Comutation of *KRAS*

Joshua H. Cook, Giorgio E. M. Melloni, Doga C. Gulhan, Peter J. Park, Kevin M. Haigis

## Purpose

The various alleles of *KRAS* have known differences in their biochemical and signaling properties. Further, there are some correlations that suggest the allele has an effect on patient outcome.

In this analysis, we aim to compare the genetic landscapes of patient tumors with the common *KRAS* alleles.
