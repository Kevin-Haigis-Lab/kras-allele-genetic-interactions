## Synthetic Lethality

Synthetic lethality refers to a genetic interaction whereby one mutation sensitizes an organism to another normally-benign mutation.
This overlaps with "dependency" whereby the first mutation pushes the organism into a state of where it relies on specific functions.
Blocking (by mutation or inhibition) this function would cause the mutant organism to die, but not effect the wild-type organisms.
Thus, finding synthetic lethal interactions in cancer
