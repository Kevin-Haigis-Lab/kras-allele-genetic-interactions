## Figure building system

I developed a system for building the figures for the paper.
It is described below.

All files for the figures are in "paper/figures/".
Each figure has a folder in "figure_protos/" that follow the format of "figure_{figure number}-{version of the figure}".
In this folder, all of the `ggplot` objects are saved for use in the full figure.
These are then used by the script "make-figure_{figure number}-{version of the figure}.R" to build the figure from these protos.
Each figure gets saved in two places: 1) as a versioned figure in the protos folder and 2) as a final figure in the "figures" directory.

The library script "libs/make-figure_helper.R" provide a standardized interface to the system.
Further, it keeps and integrates the information on formatting from the journal (NRJ).
These functions standardize the naming and paths of the protos for each figure.
Additionally, it has some helpful features for automatically using the latest version number.
There are specific functions for loading protos and for saving the final figures in the multiple locations.
