## Allele-specific synthetic lethality

I am revisiting the allele-specific synthetic lethality.
Yesterday, I increased the stringency for the cutoffs by declaring the p-value threshold for the ANOVA across genes to be 0.01.
This reduced the number of genes, as expected, but also made the heatmaps for believable and striking.
I think it is the correct choice considering we cannot use an FDR adjusted cutoff in this case.
The problem that I have run into now is that the functional enrichment does not turn out anything of remarkable interest for COAD and PAAD.
LUAD still has quite a few hits, so I may be able to use those.

## Multinomial logistic regression

### Introduction

I tried to use multinomial logistic regression to identify allele-specific synthetic lethality.
The model regressed on the allele of the cell lines and used the gene effect as the covariate.
This analysis was completed in "src/30_10_logisitic-regression-syn-let.R".

### Sources

### The model

The model had the following form:

```txt
allele ~ gene_effect
```

If available, "WT" was set as the baseline.
Otherwise (for PAAD) the first allele alphabetically (G12D) was the intercept.
The problem with this approach was that all of the comparisons were to the WT allele.
This was even worse for PAAD where the comparison was to G12D.

Therefore, I instead tried to run the same model but comparing each allele to the rest using a binomial (normal) logistic regression.

I fixed an issue with the parsing of the gene names from `depmap19Q3.Achilles.gene.dependency` and `depmap19Q3.Achilles.gene.effect`.
Gene names that normally have a hyphen instead had a period in their names.
Therefore, they were split where there should have been a hyphen.
This is unlikely to have a large effect on the results.

I re-ran the downstream munging script "munge/15_depmap19Q3_model-data-prep.R".
I re-ran 10 and 30 group of scripts (linear modeling and logistic modeling).
