## Fix bug in filtering comutation interactions

### Bug

file: `src/20_35_rc-fisher-comparison.R`  
line: `36`  
current: `(n11 / n01 > !!comutfreq_comut)`  
should be: `(n11 / (n01 + n11) > !!comutfreq_comut)`

### Process to fixing the bug

```r
# Make change and re-run the script.
source("src/20_35_rc-fisher-comparison.R")

# Re-run all downstream scripts.
downstream_scripts <- c(
    "20_40_highlivel-genetic-interactions.R",
    "20_41_disagreeing-interactions_logOR-barplot.R",
    "20_43_apriori-lists-genetic-interactions.R",
    "20_44_select-enriched-functions.R",
    "20_45_fxnal-enrich-genetic-interactions.R",
    "20_46_enriched-functions_bar-plots.R",
    "20_47_enriched-functions_signaling-pathways.R",
    "20_48_enriched-functions_compare-functions_heatmaps.R",
    "20_49_rainfall-plots-subroutines.R",
    "20_50_rainfall-plots.R",
    "20_55_lollipop_plots.R",
    "20_70_luad-g12c-stk11.R",
    "40_10_overlap-synlet-comutation.R",
    "40_12_overlap-synlet-comutation-hits.R",
    "40_15_comparing-COAD-allele-subnetworks.R",
    "40_16_comparing-LUAD-allele-subnetworks.R",
    "40_17_comparing-PAAD-allele-subnetworks.R",
    "40_20_comut-dependency-genes-ppi-connectivity.R",
    "40_25_luad_co-enriched-functions.R",

    "60_10_MM-specific-oncogenes.R",
    "90_13_comutation-network_withingroup-ppi-closeness.R"
)

for (f in downstream_scripts) {
    msg <- glue("running: '{f}'")
    cat(str_rep("=", str_length(msg)), "\n")
    cat(msg, "\n")
    cat(str_rep("=", str_length(msg)), "\n")
    
    source(file.path("src", f))
}
```

### Report on downstream effects

There were no changes to the high level graph plots for LUAD and COAD and only minor changes to those for MM and PAAD.
This indicates that the change has no effect on the results for COAD nor LUAD.
The conclusions on MM were already limited and it doesn't look like the few that are mentioned were disrupted.

There were no effects on the *a priori* interaction plots.
There was a bug in the script I had to fix, but it has no effect on output or results.
(There will be one updated in git, but it was from a change to the graph layout used that I had changed earlier but forget to update.)

I had to address a bug in "src/20_46_enriched-functions_bar-plots.R".
I'm not sure what had caused it, but I just had to remove `NA` values that previously I was allowed to leave.
Also, Enrichr seems to have made some changes on the server so now the Panther and BioCarta terms a suffix.
The removal of these were added to the `standardize_enricher_terms()` function in "lib/enrichr_wrappers.R".

The rest of the scripts rand without a hitch.
Some resulted in minor changes to plots caused by some piece that is partially randomly placed.

No results nor conclusions were affected.

### Rebuild figures

There were no changes to results and conclusions as presented in the figures and paper. 
Some of the figure panels were changed to include an `NA` section.
I think there was a change to the default behavior of some 'ggplot2' geoms, but I will address these later.
