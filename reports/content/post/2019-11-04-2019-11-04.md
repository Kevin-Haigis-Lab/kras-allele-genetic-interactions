## More attempts at modeling DepMap data

I did some reading and thinking in the morning and came up with a few more linear modeling analyses I wanted to try:

1. z(gene_effect) ~ allele
    + This is essentially what I have already done, but with z-scaled gene-effect scores.
2. A rank-sum test for each sample looking for enrichment of genes in *a priori* gene sets. I should z-scale the gene-effect scores within a gene first and then conduct the rank-sum within a sample.

### Scaled gene effect for ANOVA

I conducted the simple ANOVA test using the z-scaled gene effect scores.
The pairwise test was also conducted on the scaled values.
The results were identical - no new genes, no lost genes.
The ANOVA test was reverted to the unscaled form.

### Rank-sum test for single-sample enrichment

I ran a rank-sum test for each cell line, where the genes were ranked by the z-scaled gene-effect score.
The two groups were created by gene-sets, therefore, the test was a sample-wise gene-set enrichment test.
I used the KEGG and KEA gene sets.
These results were not very conclusive because it was difficult to make statements on the allele by the effects of a cell line.

Therefore, I also ran the same test by allele instead of by cell line.
I used the mean of the gene-effect for the cell lines of an allele and then  z-scaled.
Some of the results are shown below.

The first plot is a general overview of the enriched pathways.
Each dot represents a statistically detectable enrichment and the size of the dot correlates with the FDR-adjusted p-value.

The following are waterfall plots that show the scaled average gene-effect score for cell lines of a *KRAS* allele for the genes in an enriched gene set.
The x-axis order is by ranking of the y-axis.
