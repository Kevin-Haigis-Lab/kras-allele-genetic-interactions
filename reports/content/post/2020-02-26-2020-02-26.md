## Follow up on survival analysis hits

The samples comutated for KRAS G12C and other survival analysis hits do not seem to have more mutations than the other samples the genes are mutated in.

I also plotted the number of samples with mutations in other known oncogenes in LUAD.

## Reorganizing figures

I have notes in my paper notebook that need to be refined.
