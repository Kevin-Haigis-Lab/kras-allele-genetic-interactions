## Bug fix

At the end of yesterday, I noticed the following bug:

> There is a bug where not all of the interactions are being included.
For example, *BRAF* is only connected to G13D in the KEGG-specific interaction network.

After a bit of digging I found that the *BRAF* mutations were being labeled as significant, but were filtered out by the `filter(num_mut_per_cancer >= 3)` in "src/20_35_rc-fisher-comparison.R".
The problem was that the "num_mut_per_cancer" column was `NA` for all of the alleles except for one, G13D. 

Therefore, I adjusted "munge/30_rc-test_results-prep.R" to fix this bug.
The problem was with a data frame merging by, among other columns, *KRAS* allele.
However, since there are 0 comutation events between BRAF and some of the alleles, the values were `NA` not zero.

A test was added to make sure this is fixed (available in "tests/test-30_rc-test_results-prep.R").

All of the dependent files were re-run and the figures should now be accurate.


## Functional Enrichment (cont.)

The results from the functional enrichment were written to Excel and TSV files for independent analysis.
The data frame was also cached.

I tried multiple plotting modalities to help with parsing the results.
The attempts included a network and bar-plots, but finally settled on a dot-plot for each data source.
The x and y-axes are the *KRAS* allele and enriched terms, respectively.
The size and color of the dots indicate the "strength" of the association by representing the p-value and number of genes with genetic interactions in the gene set, respectively.
I made one plot for each data source and cancer combination.
A few examples are shown below.


### COAD

The following plot is of the Kinase Enrichment Analysis (KEA) gene sets in COAD.

The plot below is showing the enriched gene sets made up of the protein-protein interaction networks of transcription factors.

### LUAD

The following plot shows the pathways (from the PANTHER data base) enriched in the genetic interactions of *KRAS* alleles in LUAD.

### MM

The following plot shows the pathways (from the PANTHER database) enriched in the genetic interactions of *KRAS* alleles in MM.

In addition, the following shows the same, but using the BioCarta database instead.
