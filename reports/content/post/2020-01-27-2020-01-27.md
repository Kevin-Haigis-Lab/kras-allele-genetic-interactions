## LUAD added to Figure 4

I added the DepMap analysis of LUAD to Figure 4 below the results for COAD.

### No GSEA dot-plot

I did not include the dot-plot for GSEA because there weren't very many interesting results.
Therefore, I only showed two gene sets for the ERK and BARD1 pathways.

### Enrichment density plots

I replaced the enrichment bars below the gene set heatmaps with density plots above the heatmaps.
I think these make the enrichment trend more obvious and are relatively intuitive to understand.
