## MUTYH-defects in patients with high Sig. 18

During my presentation for the Friday Park Lab meeting on Feb. 2, 2020, Jake Lee and Hu Jin mentioned that Signature 18 may just be from reactive oxygen species in patients with no detectable MUTYH-defect.
Therefore, I specifically inspected this gene in patients with high Signature 18 in COAD and PAAD.

The analysis was done in "./src/60_20_mutyh-signature18-associations.R".

Plotting the density curves of levels of signature 18 showed two very distinct groups: those with 0 and those above 0.

The waterfall plot shows the distinction even more strikingly.

If I try to look for clusters in the samples with level above 0, there are no obvious places to cut.
I used a density-based method that identifies local minima in a density plot.

Therefore, I decided to just use any sample with a signature 18 level above 0.
There were 418 COAD and 137 PAAD samples.
21 of the COAD samples had a *KRAS* G12C mutation, and 4 of the PAAD samples had a *KRAS* G12C mutation.

Of these samples, only 4 had coding mutations in MUTYH.
Thus, without germline data, I cannot tell if these samples had MUTYH-defects.

**Conclusion: I should rephrase the wording of the paper to reflect that Sig. 18 may be from MUTYH-defects or ROS.**
