## Preparation for lab meeting presentation

Today, I just needed to make a few simple plots and augment some others for my lab meeting presentation.

The first was a plot of the distribution of *KRAS* alleles across the cancers.
This was done in "src/90_05_kras-allele-distribution.R"

![](/img/grpahs/90_05_kras-allele-distribution/allele_dist_barplot_stackplot.svg)

The next change was to make the overlap-network plots more "presentation-friendly" by adjusting the dimensions, color hues, and font size.
I did not put an image here, because they are likely to be changed for the publication.
