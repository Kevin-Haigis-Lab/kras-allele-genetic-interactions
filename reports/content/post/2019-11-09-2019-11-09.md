## Touch-ups and preparations for figures-quality images

I spent today taking casre of some smaller, but necessary, adjustments to previously created figures in order to prepare them for use a figure.

### Standardizing color palettes for comutation and synthetic lethality

I want a pair of colors for comutation vs. mutual exclusivity and another pair for synthetic lethal up and down.

While I was at it, I made my own palette-display function. Below are the rest of the palettes used throughout the paper.

### Make more tightly packed high-level genetic interaction networks

Since the purpose of the high-level genetic interaction networks is to show thee relations between the alleles, it need not take up too much space.
I made small figures that will still relay our point, but not take up half the figure.
These replace the "thick" versions.

### PAAD

### Finalize distribution of interactions plot

I just tidied up this plot that was originally just for my own use.

## To-Do tomorrow

What I should do tomorrow:

1. Update the heatmap for synthetic lethality to use the new color palette.
2. Finally fix the observed vs. predicted *KRAS* alleles.
