## Strange mistake with GSEA of DepMap for PAAD cell lines

For some reason, the G12V vs. Other labeling is backwards for the results of GSEA of the PAAD cell lines.
I really don't know what caused this, though am highly confident of this by looking at the raw data of the enriched gene sets.
Also, looking at the heatmaps of some enriched gene sets, it shws the G12V cell lines labeled as Other.

I fixed this by just multiplying the ES and NES scores for this condition by -1.

## Closeness of comutation networks

From a talk I went to, I wanted to try measuring the closeness of the genes in the *KRAS* allele comiutation networks.
It would be interesting if the genes within a comutation network were more close to each other than those outside of the comutation network.

I ran a pilot analysis with COAD and found nothing interesting.
The bar-plot below shows the distribution of shortest distance between genes in the comutation network of the two *KRAS* alleles along the x-axis and y-facet.

The heatmap below shows the mean shortest distance values for genes in the comutation networks of the indicated alleles.

### Conclusion

There isn't much to see because the STRING PPI is so well connected.

### Follow-up analyses

* Try using the HINT PPI instead of the STRING PPI.
* Use different metric of "closeness": similarity, mean distance, flow, number of shortest-paths, hit-rate (likelihood of hitting node on a random walk).

## Genetic dependency of PAAD cell lines on *JUN* and *CDKN2A/B*

*JUN* is a transcription factor that regulates expression of *CDKN2A* and *CDKN2B* (*CDKN2A/B*) in *KRAS*-driven CRC ([Serra *et al.*, 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24623306-a-kras-directed-transcriptional-silencing-pathway-that-mediates-the-cpg-island-methylator-phenotype/?from_single_result=A+KRAS-directed+transcriptional+silencing+pathway+that+mediates+the+CpG+island+methylator+phenotype.))
It regulates the levels of the nuclear deubiquitinase USP28, which deubiquitinates (stabilizes) the TF ZNF304 which transcribes the genes at the tumor suppressor genes *CDKN2A/B*.
Therefore, hyperactive *KRAS* increases cJUN activity, which increases the levels of USP28, which increases the stability of ZNF304.
ZNF304 binds to the promoters of *CDKN2A/B*, recruiting a corepressor complex, stifling the expression of these 3 tumor suppressor genes.

Further, research showed that the MAPK pathway connects KRAS to JUN via MAP2K4, MAP2K7 (which together make JNK), and MAPK8 (JNK1).
Also, another tumor suppressor gene, MEN1 or Menin, "uncouples" the MAPK pathway from the transcriptions factors Elk1 (*ELK1*), Jun-D (*JUND*), and cJun (*JUN*) ([Gallo *et al.*, 2002](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12226747-menin-uncouples-elk-1-jund-and-c-jun-phosphorylation-from-map-kinase-activation/)).

Here are some interesting plots of various features.
I'm not sure I want to probe further, expect maybe with MAPK8 (JNK1), which activates, via phosphorylation, JUN, ATF2, and JDP2.
