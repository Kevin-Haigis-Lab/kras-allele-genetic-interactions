## Remove G13D from the synthetic lethal analysis in LUAD

Because of the realization that knocking out *KRAS* in *KRAS* G13D mutant LUAD cell lines had no greater effect than knocking out WT *KRAS*, we decided to remove it from the analysis.
Thus, it was removed in "src/10_10_linear-modeling-syn-let.R" and all downstream analysis were re-run.
I also replaced the manual cluster assignment labels with the originals in "src/10_11_syn-let_heatmaps-boxplots.R".

```r
scripts <- c(
    "10_10_linear-modeling-syn-let.R",
    "10_11_syn-let_heatmaps-boxplots.R",
    "10_13_linear-modeling-syn-let_fxnal-enrichment.R",
    "10_15_linear-modeling-syn-let_ppi-subnetworks.R",
    "10_17_linear-modeling-syn-let_specific-protein-types.R"
)

for (script in scripts) {
    cat(glue("Running {script}... "))
    source(file.path("src", script))
    cat("done\n")
}
```

Also, the cell lines were removed from the GSEA and the LUAD samples were re-run.
I also adjusted the downstream analyses of these results to remove G13D cell lines in LUAD.
