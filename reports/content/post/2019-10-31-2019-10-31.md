## Notes from Haigis Lab Retreat 2019

## Descriptive plots for cell lines used by DepMap

### Plan

The plots to make:

- CGC mutations


The plots are shown below.

### CGC Mutations

A plot showing the mutations to CGC genes in each cell line was made for each cancer.
A dot in the tile indicates that it is a known hotspot mutation.
