## Fix GSEA

The problem I ran into yesterday was that there are some enriched gene sets that do not have enrichment plots ("enplot").
I guess that's just how GSEA does it.

While figuring this out, though, I saw that GSSEA thought there were 18 COAD G12V samples and 3 "other" - this is backwards.
After some careful inspection, I was able to confirm the relationship between the depletion effect in DepMap and NES from GSEA:

> stronger to weaker depletion = positive to negative NES

## Update synthetic lethal project page

I finished updating the project page for the synthetic lethal portion of the paper.

## Update comutation project page

I updated the comutation project page with a few new figures.
Namely, I added the dot-plot that shows the distribution of the mutually exclusive events for the cancers and the related oncoplots.

To-do tomorrow

Continue selecting the genes to show for the more selective oncoplots.
ALso, I need to make them for the genetic interaction network of the *a priori* lists.

I have some notes in my notebook I took while at the GRIP talks that need to be transcribed to the "TODO.md" file.
