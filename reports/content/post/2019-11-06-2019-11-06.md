## Fix GSEA

The problem I ran into yesterday was that there are some enriched gene sets that do not have enrichment plots ("enplot").
I guess that's just how GSEA does it.

While figuring this out, though, I saw that GSSEA thought there were 18 COAD G12V samples and 3 "other" - this is backwards.
After some careful inspection, I was able to confirm the relationship between the depletion effect in DepMap and NES from GSEA:

> stronger to weaker depletion = positive to negative NES
