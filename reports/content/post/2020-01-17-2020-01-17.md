## Fig 4. Synthetic lethal COAD

I began work on the synthetic lethal figure for COAD.
I may be able to stick all three on one figure, though, in the future.

### Adding `pheatmap` object

Including a `pheatmap` object in a patchwork is tricky.
I split up the legends from the rest of the plot and stuck them on their own so I have more control over their placement.

**To-Do:** I need to add a title to the main color bar saying "scaled dep. score".

**To-Do:** Re-analyze the GSEA results.
I re-ran the tool having it output for of the "enplots" and associated data so that I could plot it.
Once I have re-analyzed it, there should be more available to show as the ranked-heatmaps.
