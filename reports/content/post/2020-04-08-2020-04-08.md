**The following are notes for what I need to take care of for this project.**

## Error in code

file: `src/20_35_rc-fisher-comparison.R`  
line: `36`  
current: `(n11 / n01 > !!comutfreq_comut)`  
should be: `(n11 / (n01 + n11) > !!comutfreq_comut)`

This needs to be fixed and all downstream analyses re-run.
This process should be carefully thought out and executed.


## Summary statistics of comutation interactions

I will compute summary statistics for the comutation interactions including the following per cancer per allele:

* number of genes with an interaction
* number of genes with only one interaction
* the percent of genes with only one interaction
* distribution (min, max, quantile, s.d.) of mutation frequency (and absolute number), comutation frequency (an absolute number)


## FDR for Dependency Map analysis

Use a permutation test to find a FDR for the DepMap analysis.
I might even be able to use more of the DepMap cell lines to increase the number of possible permutations.
However, only cell lines with the same origin should be compared at a time.
