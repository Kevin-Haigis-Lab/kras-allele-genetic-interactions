## Survival analysis (cont.)

I continued with the survival analysis from the past few days.

I wanted to assess the effect of the following covariates on the survival curves:

* patient's age
* patient's sex
* tumor stage

For MM, I needed to return to the munge script and extract that information.

### Sex covariate

MM was the only tumor where sex of the patient was a significant covariate

###  Tumor stage covariate

Tumor stage behaves exactly as expected.
