## Preparing for CRUK presentation

OP and I decided that I should just present the comutation project at today's CRUK in-person meeting for the trainees.
I made new versions of the genetic interaction networks with thicker edges to be more easily viewed on the screens.

The final presentation was copied to "presentations/2019.10.21_CRUK.pptx".
