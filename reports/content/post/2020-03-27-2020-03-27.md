## Integration ananlysis for LUAD and PAAD

( I did not do an analysis for MM because the comutation network was so sparse and there was no dependency analysis for the cancer.)

The two new analysis are in separate scripts, though they both use functions from the original COAD script:

* LUAD: `40_16_comparing-LUAD-allele-subnetworks.R`
* PAAD: `40_17_comparing-PAAD-allele-subnetworks.R`

For LUAD, because the network was so large, it was further filtered for only the *a priori* gene set used earlier in the comutation analysis section.

### Annotations using 'ggforce'

To add 'ggforce' annotations, I needed to install the 'concaveman' package which, in turn, was dependent upon ['sf'](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf).
'sf' required 3 other software packages to run: GDAL, GEOS, and Proj.4.
GDAL is available on O2, and can be loaded with:

```bash
module load gcc gdal
```

GEOS required manual installation.
Following their [instructions](https://github.com/libgeos/geos/blob/master/INSTALL), below are the commands I used:

```bash
module load gcc

cd ~/mysoftware

# Download the latest release (not development version v3.9.0)
wget https://github.com/libgeos/geos/archive/3.8.1.zip
unzip 3.8.1.zip
cd geos-3.8.1

./autogen.sh

mkdir ~/mysoftware/geos-bin
mkdir obj && cd obj
../configure --prefix=/home/jc604/mysoftware/geos-bin

make

make install
```

The paths to the three directories (bin, include, and lib) were added to the `PATH` global variable in `.bash_profile`:

```bash
# For GEOS
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/mysoftware/geos-bin/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/mysoftware/geos-bin/include
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/mysoftware/geos-bin/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/mysoftware/geos-bin/lib
```

Finally, Proj.4 was already installed and I didn't need to take any extra steps.
