## Standardizing themes

I standardized the figures by creating the `theme_comutation()` function.
This should be applied to every plot first, then `theme()` can be used to tweak it for the specific plot and figure.

## Gallery of the figures on website

All of the figures are now available on the website in the "Gallery".


## Manuscript moved to Overleaf

I decided to move the manuscript to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), an on-line, full-featured LaTeX editor.
