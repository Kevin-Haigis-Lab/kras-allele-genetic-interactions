## Average gene effect for *KRAS* in G13D LUAD cell lines

I included the fact that we remove G13D cell lines from LUAD dependency analysis in the Methods section.
For evidence, I also included the average gene effect scores of *KRAS* in G13D LUAD, all WT, and all other mutants.

|group                  | avg_gene_effect| stddev_gene_effect|
|:----------------------|---------------:|------------------:|
|LUAD G13D              |      -0.5534650|          0.2600804|
|all WT                 |      -0.5530092|          0.2793851|
|all other KRAS mutants |      -1.2639220|          0.3292334|
