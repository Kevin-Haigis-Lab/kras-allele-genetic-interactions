## Munging DepMap 2019 Q3 release (cont.)

### Sample Info

Information about all of the cell lines is available in "data/depmap19Q3/sample_info.csv". I added a column `"cancer"` with the TCGA cancer names for each cell line; a `NA` value means it isn't used in this project.
I also joined `kras_mutation_tib`.
Note, that this will duplicate any rows with multiple *KRAS* mutations.

### Gene Effect

This is the data for the effect of knocking out a gene.
The tall-format tibble was saved to `gene_effect`.

### Gene Dependency

This is the data for the probability that a cell line is dependent upon the target gene.
The tall-format tibble was saved to `dependency_prob`.

### RNAi 

KH has indicated some interest in using the RNAi experimental data, too.

The data was obtained from DepMap.

```bash
wget -O data/depmap19Q3/D2_combined_gene_dep_scores.csv  https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/13515395
```

The tall-format tibble was saved to `rnai_effect`.


## Preparing data for modeling

A new munging script was created to create the input data for the modeling of depletion effect by *KRAS* allele: "munge/15_depmap19Q3_model-data-prep.R".

The first step was to identify the cell lines with multiple oncogenic KRAS mutations. 
They cannot be used for the analysis.

Cell lines with a *BRAF* V600E or oncogenic *NRAS* mutation will be removed, too.

A base data frame was created for the modeling data.
Only the cell lines for the relevant cancers were kept.
It has the *KRAS* mutation information for each cell line and two columns for whether the gene is noted as essential or nonessential by DepMap (`NA` if neither).
This data frame was cached as "model_data_base".

Only alleles with at least 3 cell lines can be considered for this analysis.
Another data frame was created to reflect this.

734 genes for 3 cell lines were `NA` in the raw data.
The cell lines were ACH-000118 (PAAD, *KRAS* G12R) ACH-000658 (MM, *KRAS* WT) ACH-001061 (COAD, *KRAS* WT).
These data points were removed.

Not all genes will be tested in the analysis because they do not exhibit a strong enough of a lethal effect.
There were two criteria:

1. a manual threshold of causing a depletion effect of -0.2 in at least two cell lines
2. a metric based on a comparison of the scores in essential and non-essential genes

The threshold for the first criteria was two standard deviations above the mean of essential genes.
The threshold for the second criteria was at the point where the distributions of the depletion effects of the essential and nonessential genes overlapped.
By eye, these two cut-offs were fairly similar for each cancer.
I should do an analysis of the effect of various cut-offs for the number of genes (added to TODO/Analyses/)

RNA expression for each gene of each cell line was added as another column to the model data frame.

Another column was added to the model data frame called `"is_altered"`. It is true if there is a CNA or coding mutation in the cell line's gene (else false).

This final data frame was saved as `model_data_base` where "base" denotes that it has all of the data to use for all of the models.

Another data frame was built from `model_data_base` that only has the data for *KRAS* alleles (including WT) that have at least 3 cell lines.
This was cached as `model_data`.

### TODO

I have forgotten to include the list of genes that can confidently be ignored from analysis for each cancer.
I need to integrate these data in, too.
