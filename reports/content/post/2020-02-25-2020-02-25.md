## New panels for Figure 5

From yesterday:

I found two similar pathways enriched in the comutation analysis and genetic dependency analysis in LUAD G12C:

* comutation: "positive regulation of MAPK pathway" - enriched in increased comutation interactions
* dependency: "Erk pathway" - reduced dependency

Thus, I will analyze the PPI subnetwork of the combination of these two sets of genes.
This analysis was conducted in "src/40_25_luad_co-enriched-functions.R"

## KEGG pathways as backbone

I'm thinking I can use the KEGG pathways as a backbone for analyzing the presenting the enriched MAPK functions.

To this end, I created a detailed API for getting KEGG pathways (KGML files downloaded from the website) into tidygraph objects.
These functions are located in "lib/kegg-pathway-api.R".
(*Note, this could be turned into a package at some point.*)
I then used it to prepare the MAPK and RAS signaling pathways in "munge/43_kegg-pathways.R" and cached the pathways in a named list `kegg_pathway_grs`.

This pursuit became quite frustrating.
I was able to finally get a tidygraph of multiple KEGG pathways and so some preliminary analysis, but still the results were not very exciting.

I will return to this tomorrow.

## Analysis of survival curve analysis results

I took a longer look at the survival curve analysis results.
Here is my summary for moving forward and including it in the paper.

### LUAD

I found several genes that have significant trends with G12C in LUAD when compred to *KRAS* WT samples:

| gene    | comutation | survival curve notes    | allele p-value | comutation p-value |
|---------|------------|-------------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| ARID1A  | reduced    | stronger when comutated | sig.           | sig.               |
| CHRNB4  | increased  | stronger when comutated | not sig.       | sig.               |
| VN1R2   | increased  | stronger together       | 0.0661         | 0.0161             |
| ZNF445  | increased  | stronger together       | 0.0542         | 0.024              |
| ZNF804A | reduced    | weaker together         | < 0.1          | < 0.1              |

In addition, ZNF445 was significant when compred to only other *KRAS* mutant samples.

**To-Do**:

- fix the coloration of the lines in the "alleleorwt" series
- check for other mutations in the samples with comutation or the other gene is mutated

### PAAD

The story of TP53 in PAAD between G12D and G12V samples is still interesting.

TP53 has increased comutation with G12D and reduced with G12V.
However, there are still many samples with both G12V and TP53, just fewer than would be expected given the frequency of TP53 mutations and mutation rate in G12V samples.

For G12D, the G12D only and G12D with TP53 mutant survival curves are the same, the TP53 only curve is intermediate to those and the WT both genes curve.
For G12V, the TP53 only and G12V with TP53 curves are the strongest and almost identical, while the WT both curve is intermediate, and the G12V only samples have the best survival.

Together, these results suggest that the G12V mutation is redundant to TP53 mutation, while the TP53 mutation and G12D mutations are cooperative.
