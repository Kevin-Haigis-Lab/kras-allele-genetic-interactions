## New panels for Figure 5

From yesterday:

I found two similar pathways enriched in the comutation analysis and genetic dependency analysis in LUAD G12C:

* comutation: "positive regulation of MAPK pathway" - enriched in increased comutation interactions
* dependency: "Erk pathway" - reduced dependency

Thus, I will analyze the PPI subnetwork of the combination of these two sets of genes.
This analysis was conducted in "src/40_25_luad_co-enriched-functions.R"

## KEGG pathways as backbone

I'm thinking I can use the KEGG pathways as a backbone for analyzing the presenting the enriched MAPK functions.

To this end, I created a detailed API for getting KEGG pathways (KGML files downloaded from the website) into tidygraph objects.
These functions are located in "lib/kegg-pathway-api.R".
(*Note, this could be turned into a package at some point.*)
I then used it to prepare the MAPK and RAS signaling pathways in "munge/43_kegg-pathways.R" and cached the pathways in a named list `kegg_pathway_grs`.

This pursuit became quite frustrating.
I was able to finally get a tidygraph of multiple KEGG pathways and so some preliminary analysis, but still the results were not very exciting.

I will return to this tomorrow.
