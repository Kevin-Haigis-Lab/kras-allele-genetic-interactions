## Bootstrap CI for comutation tests

The test for increased frequency of comutation, a one-sided Fisher's exact test, provides a confidence interval for its measured statistic.
The test for reduced frequency of comutation, the RC-test, does not automatically provide a confidence interval.
Therefore, I bootstrapped 95% CI from the real results.
This analysis was conducted in "src/20_33_rc-test-bootstrap-ci.R".

### Test Snakemake-run RC-test

I have yet to test if I properly adapted the Snakemake work-flow for use in this ProjectTemplate architecture.
I ran the following small-scale analysis (after copying the real intermediates and results to backups):

- only 100 permutations by setting `NUM_PERMS = 10`
- run the work-flow for COAD A146T and G12A

I created a new example DAG with these parameters set.

![](/img/graphs/20_20_rc-test-Snakefile/dag.pdf)

The work-flow starts by generating the input using "src/20_02_prepare-input-tables.R".

```r
source("src/20_02_prepare-input-tables.R")
```
