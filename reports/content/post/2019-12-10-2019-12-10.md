## Figure 2 (version 1, continued)

The oncoplots from 'maftools' are only available as SVG files.
While I found a potential way of reading them and incorporating them into 'patchwork', it was not flexible enough for the iterative and precise process of figure making.
Therefore, I implemented oncoplots using 'ggplot' in "lib/ggmaftools.R"

I used patchwork for laying out the grid of subplots.
I created an algorithmic solution to the layout that can be adjusted via a parameter to the function.
There is an ASCII diagram in ``ggmaftools.R` to explain what each parameter controls on the grid.
