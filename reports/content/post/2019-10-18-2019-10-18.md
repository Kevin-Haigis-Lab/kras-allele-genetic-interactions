## Analysis of GSEA results (cont.)

Yesterday, I was able to plot the results from the GSEA before the end of the day.
The plots of the GSEA results don't show anything terribly interesting.
Dot-plots for each cancer are shown below.
The gene set is displayed if it has a Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) of greater than 1.2 or less than -1.2 and a FDR-adjusted p-value of less than 0.20.

**Quick side note** - I was curious about the relationship between the dependency on NF1 and *KRAS* allele in COAD cell lines.
I therefore made a quick bar-plot showing this relationship in "src/90_10_NF1-depletion-COAD.R".
I'm not sure how to interpret the results, but will show KH.

## Analysis of gene clusters from simple DepMap model.

I looked for weakly connected components in the STRING PPI with the genes from each cluster of genes (with at least 4 nodes). 
To be clear, these are the same clusters as those shown in the heatmaps.
Plots of all the components are in "graphs/10_15_linear-modeling-syn-let_ppi-subnetworks/".
Some are shown below.

## To-Do


For synthetic lethal portion: 

- specific plots for types of genes in the gene clusters
    + transcription factors
    + hubs in PPI
    + chromatin modifiers
    + cell cycle

For comutation portion:

- plot p-value vs. cumulative number of genes for comutation and mutually exclusive
- plot p-value vs. number of events for co-mutation and mutual exclusivity
