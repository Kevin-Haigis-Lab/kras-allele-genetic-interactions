I have outlined an estimate for a time-line for the rest of the project to the first submission.
It is located on the homepage of this website.

## Modeling KRAS allele-specific synthetic lethality

I began by trying to use a linear model, regressing on KRAS allele, RNA expression of the tarter, and whether the target was altered (CN amplification or coding mutation).
I then used a step-wise AIC feature selection method to optimize the model for each gene.
I ran into a problem, however, in how to declare the intercept of the model.
Originally, I had the WT allele set as the intercept, but this is irrelevant for the RNA expression feature.
To further complicate matters, PAAD does not have enough WT *KRAS* cell lines, so the intercept was set to *KRAS* G12D.
This is obviously not what we want to model

Therefore, I have changed to a two-step process. 
First, I regress the depletion effect on the RNA expression of the target gene.
The genes with a significant model (p < 0.01) are discorded.
The second step is to run an ANOVA and conduct pair-wise T-tests.


**Problem: While doing this, I realized that LUAD only has enough cell lines (at least 3) for WT and G12C, but not G12V like there was before.**
I found that the problem was I specifically selected cell lines by their disease subtype containing "Adenocarcinoma".
I changed the selection criteria for the lung cell lines to `linear_subtype == "lung_NSC"`.
The problem was resolved.
