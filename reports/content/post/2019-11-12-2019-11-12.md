## Fix observed vs predicted *KRAS* allele frequency plots

I separated each cancer into its own plot and also provided a copy showing the statistical significance in the shape and size of the point.
I fixed yesterday's notebook to reflect these changes.

I also removed the *KRAS* mutations themselves from factoring into the prediction, but the change had little effect on any of the predictions.


## Minor fixes to other plots

I addressed the minor styling changes to the plots mentioned in yesterday notebook: 

1. To waterfall plots in "90_03_mutation-burden-distribution": make shorter and wider
2. "20_35_rc-fisher-comparison/rc_mutations_distribition.svg": let each axis scale separately.

## Table of mutation rates of all genes

I added a section to "src/20_50_rainfall-plots.R" to make a table of rates of comutation with each allele, with mutant KRAS, with WT, and overall.
