## Logistic Regression 

*This analysis was done in "src/30_10_logisitic-regression-syn-let.R".*

Instead of regressing on all of the alleles at once using a multinomial logistic regression, I began by trying to use a logistic model to regress on each allele one-at-a-time comparing it to all of the others.
The reasons for not using the multinomial model are described on 2019-10-24.

The results were rather disappointing.
There were very few significant findings for COAD (1) and PAAD (2) and the ones for LUAD (458) were not very convincing when plotted.
Since there were only a few, I save the plots for the hits for COAD and PAAD.

I was planning on doing a LASSO logistic regression, regressing on the alleles with all of the genes at once, but there are not enough samples to split into training and test sets for calculating the $\lambda$ with cross validation.

### Conclusion

Seeing these results, I do not think it is worth further pursuing logistic regression for this analysis.

## Comutation networks

### Minimum p-value for exclusivity test

I have finally gone back to the munging of the results of the RC-test and included the minimum p-value.
The minimum p-value I used is the one recommend by the WExT paper:

> We assume that there is a nonzero probability that a gene is mutated in a sample, and thus set [the weight to] $\frac{1}{2N}$ when no mutation in gene $g_i$ is observed in sample $s_j$...

 -- ["A weighted exact test for mutually exclusive mutations in cancer." Leiserson *et al.*, 2016]

Therefore, the lowest p-values will be $\frac{1}{2 \times 10000}$.

Following these changes, I re-ran all downstream analyses.


### New exploratory plots

I created a few more exploratory plots that help visualize the results from the RC test a bit better.

The first two below show the distribution of p-values from the RC-test and Fisher's exact test.

The next plot shows the distribution of the effect size of the mutually exclusive interactions found with the RC-test.
The x-axis is the log-transformed p-value and the y-axis is the ratio of the number of mutually exclusive events and the number of samples in the cancer.
Each dot is a gene found to have a significant mutually exclusive interaction with the allele that its color points to.
The size and transparency of each dot indicate the mutational frequency of the gene.

### Rainfall plots for top interactions

As I discussed in yesterday's notebook, Jake Lee (Park Lab) mentioned that I should use a rainfall plot to show some of the mutually exclusive and comutation interactions, the standard visualization for these analyses.

This analysis was conducted in "src/20_50_rainfall-plots.R".

I began by working to conform to the MAF format so that I could use 'maftools'.
This process went over my memory budget and canceled my R session.
I took this as a good stopping point for the day...
