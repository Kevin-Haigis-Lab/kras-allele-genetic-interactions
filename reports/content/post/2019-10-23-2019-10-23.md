## Plots for specific types of genes (cont.)

(This was started on 2019-10-21.)

The gene sets have been prepared earlier.
There was a bug though - each gene set was using the path to the KEA file.
This was fixed.

I couldn't decide on whether or not to normalize the depletion effect scores for the plots.
If I don't, then most of the differences are between genes, but if I do, then the y-axis is essentially meaningless.
I decided to scale the values, but I may want to revisit this decision.

The plots for the specific gene types for the clusters are in "graphs/10_17_linear-modeling-syn-let_specific-protein-types/".

I decided to return to the original clustering to find more conservative/believable results.
Therefore, I reduced the p-value cutoff for the ANOVA to p-value < 0.01.
This obviously reduced the number of hits, but also created tighter clusters.
Below are the new heatmaps (though they will replace the originals in a previous notebook, anyways).

### COAD

### LUAD

### PAAD

![](/img/graphs/10_10_linear-modeling-syn-let_pheatmaps/PAAD_CRISPR_pheatmap.svg)


The number of hits for COAD and PAAD were significantly reduced to where I could show the gene names.
LUAD still has many hits.

The functional enrichment clustering did not turn up much for COAD, plenty for LUAD, and a few kinases/hubs for PAAD.
I will continue working on this, tomorrow.

Slight digression to make plots for KH's presentation. 
They were plots of the high-level genetic interactions for G12V across the cancers.
They are in "graphs/20_40_highlivel-genetic-interactions/".

plot idea: enriched gene sets from genetic interactions vs. enriched gene sets from syn. let.

## Notes on KH's CRUK presentation

- the size of networks is in part determined by statistical
- use biological "priors" to prioritize hits
