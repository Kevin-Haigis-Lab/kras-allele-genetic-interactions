## Mutational signature distributions 

I added descriptors to some of the mutational signatures as GM did, previously.
The only difference is that I did not designate a specific POLE signature because it was only the accumulation of signature 10A through 10C.

The final product is below.

**To-Do**: I need to make a plot of the probability of each mutational signature creating each mutation in the samples with the allele.

**To-Do**: What is the probability for each mutational signature causing the KRAS mutation of a sample.
("src/50_30_mutsignatures_prob-causing-allele.R".)

**To-Do:** Re-run the analysis script for GSEA results.
There should be fewer genesets without data.
