## Comparisons of the probability of a mutational signature causing an allele

I remade some of the plots showing the probability that a mutational signature caused a *KRAS* allele.
The selections and the reason for their selection are as follows:

1. COAD sig. 18: G12C spike
2. LUAD sig. 4: smoking
3. MM sig. 9: spike in Q61H
4. PAAD sig. 8: uneven distribution of this unknown mutational signature

## Distribution of mutational signature levels: focusing on Clock

I made boxplots of the cumulative levels of the clock signatures (1 and 5) to the rest.

I also made a scatter plot of the clock vs. smoke levels in LUAD.

## Allele frequency for all alleles

I made a barplot of KRAS allele frequency that includes all alleles with at least 3 appearances.
These were grouped in "Other" in the first plot.
This will be included as a supplemental.

**To-Do:**
Assemble the final Figure 1.
I need to save the graph images to a new directory for this step in the paper (something like: "figures/figure_1_1/....rds") and then use patchwork to put everything together.
