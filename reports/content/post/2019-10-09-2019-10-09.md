## Finish preparing RC-test results

The final step was to merge the actual mutation numbers for each gene to the results from the RC-test.

These new values were used to update the plots made in "20_30_rc-test-results-analysis.R" (also shown in the notebook for 2019-10-07).

### General scope of results

Below is the number of significant interactions (p-value < 0.05 and at-least 3 events) per cancer found by the RC-test.

The plot below separates the bars by the type of interaction.

## Munge Fisher's test for comutation results

To compare against the RC test, I prepared the results from GM's test for comutation (a Fisher's exact test).
The file "OR_fisher_multiTest_Aug2019.txt" was copied from the shared DropBox to "data/fisher-comutation".
It is prepared for further use in "munge/35_comutation-results-gm.R".

For future reference, here is the 2x2 table that GM used for the columns `n00` through `n11`:

|          |     | **KRAS** |     |
|----------|-----|----------|-----|
|          |     | WT       | mut |
| **gene** | WT  | n00      | n01 |
|          | mut | n10      | n11 |

## Comparing results from Fisher's test and RC-test

This comparison was conducted in "src/20_35_rc-fisher-comparison.R".

The first plot just shows the gross number of genes found to be signficant for each test, split by comutation and mutual exclusivity.

This plot shows a large discrepancy between the two tests: the RC-test was more sensitive when testing for mutual exclusivity while the opposite was true for the Fisher's exact test.
On closer inspection, it seemed that the Fisher's test out-performed the RC-test for detecting comutation because we were able to use the panel data.
The panel data could not be used for the RC-test because the test accounts for the total number of mutations in the sample.

**From these results, I propose that we use the Fisher's test for comutation and RC-test for mutual exclusivity.** This makes sense in so far as the RC-test was originally made for detecting mutual exclusivity and is equivalent (when comparing two genes) to the Fisher's exact test for comutation as it approaches the limit.
Therefore, it is an approximation where it is not needed because we can just do the Fisher's exact test.
