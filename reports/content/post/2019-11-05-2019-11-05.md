## RANi-screen Analysis

I conducted the same analysis as was previously done on the CRISPR screen.
Therefore, the analysis was added to "src/10_10_linear-modeling-syn-let.R".

The data was first prepared in "munge/15_depmap19Q3_model-data-prep.R".
All missing data was removed.
There are a lot more cell lines per allele.

| cancer | allele | n  |
|--------|--------|----|
| COAD   | G12V   |  4 |
| COAD   | G13D   |  5 |
| COAD   | G12D   |  7 |
| COAD   | WT     | 13 |
| LUAD   | G12V   |  6 |
| LUAD   | G12C   | 13 |
| LUAD   | WT     | 54 |
| PAAD   | G12R   |  4 |
| PAAD   | G12V   |  8 |
| PAAD   | G12D   | 18 |

The results are rather unimpressive.
To begin, there is a lot of missing data!
I looked on DepMaps website and data portal but couldn't find an explanation.
Also, there were not very many striking differences between the alleles.
The heatmaps for each cancer are below.

### LUAD

### PAAD

### Conclusion

It does not seem like these results are worth further investigating.
