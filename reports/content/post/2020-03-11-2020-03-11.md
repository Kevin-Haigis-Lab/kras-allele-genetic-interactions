## Closeness to *KRAS* (for Yi-Jang)

### The request

Yi-Jang send me the following message on Slack:

> Talking to Kevin recently, he mentioned that you could look at PPI networks to look at how closely a particular gene product linked to KRAS. 
> Is this a quick process and if so, can I ask you to look at 3 genes for me?
> HSPA13, TP53BP2, and ZKSCAN8 are the hits Iâ€™m trying to validate in vivo for G13D-specific synthetic lethality, and it would strengthen our case for following up with these genes if they showed either direct or close interactional relationships with KRAS.
> I tried to do this on the HMS Bioplex platform, but it was not super informative.
> Thanks!

### Analysis

I conducted the analysis of in "src/90_32_yijang_closeness-to-kras.R" using the combined PPIN.
I measured the shortest distance between *KRAS* and each of the genes and also the number of shortest paths.
I bootstrapped p-values for both metrics.
The final table is below and also available in "tables/90_32_yijang_closeness-to-kras/shortest-path-statistics.tsv".

|Gene    | Shortest dist.| Avg. shortest dist.| std. dev| p-value| Num. of shortest paths| Avg. number paths| std. dev.| p-value|
|:-------|--------------:|-------------------:|--------:|-------:|----------------------:|-----------------:|---------:|-------:|
|HSPA13  |              2|            2.918367|      0.5|   0.173|                      2|             72.05|     147.6|    0.81|
|TP53BP2 |              2|            2.730000|      0.7|   0.340|                      9|             39.06|      69.6|    0.71|
|ZKSCAN8 |              3|            3.350000|      0.6|   0.600|                     36|             44.94|      93.7|    0.77|


I saved plots of the graphs of the shortest paths to "graphs/90_32_yijang_closeness-to-kras".

![](/img/graphs/90_32_yijang_closeness-to-kras/shortest-path_KRAS-ZKSCAN8.svg)

### Conclusion

The results are not terribly exciting.
These PPIN are so well-connected that to find a meaningful interaction with this sort of analysis is rare (for reference, the longest path from one protein to another is 12 steps).
I would interpret these results as a null conclusion: they neither prove nor disprove a hypothesis.
