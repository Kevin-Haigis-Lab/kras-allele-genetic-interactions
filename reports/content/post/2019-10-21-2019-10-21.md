## Plots for specific types of genes

### Sources

**Transcription Factors**

I found a list of transcription factors from the [TF2DNA Database](http://www.fiserlab.org/tf2dna_db/index.html).
In the "Downloads" tab, I downloaded and unarchived the "TF matrix files".
The file names were taken as a list of transcription factors.

I also used the `ChEA_2106` gene set from Enrichr that pulled data from [ChEA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2944209/).
The names of the gene sets contained transcription factors.

**Hubs of the PPIN**

The `PPI_Hub_Proteins` gene set was taken from Enrichr.
The original data source was [X2Kweb](https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/X2K/).

**Kinases**

A list of kinases was acquired from the [Kinase Enrichment Aalysis](https://www.maayanlab.net/KEA2/).
The actual gene set was taken from Enrichr: `KEA_2015`.

**Cell Cycle Regulators**

A list of cell-cycle regulators was taken from KEGG's `CELL_CYCLE` gene set and Reactome's `CELL_CYCLE_MITOTIC` gene set.
The gene sets were taken from the MSigDB C2 list.

The preparation of each of these data sets was added to "munge/37_gene-list-preparation.R".
