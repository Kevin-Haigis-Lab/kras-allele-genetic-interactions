## More accurate calculation of total distribution of mutations at *KRAS* hotspots

For each cancer location (e.g. colorectal), I gathered the fraction of cases that are the studied in this project (e.g. COAD).
They are shown below along with their sources.

| Cancer | Percent | Source                                                                                      |
|--------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| COAD   | 0.96    | ACS: https://www.cancer.org/cancer/colon-rectal-cancer/about/what-is-colorectal-cancer.html |
| LUAD   | 0.50    | PMID: 25822850                                                                              |
| MM     | 1.00    |                                                                                             |
| PAAD   | 0.95    | ACS: https://www.cancer.org/cancer/pancreatic-cancer/about/what-is-pancreatic-cancer.html   |
| SKCM   | 1.00    | --                                                                                          |

I integrated these values into the analysis and recalculated the distribution:

|codon | avg_codon_freq| adj_codon_freq|
|:-----|--------------:|--------------:|
|12    |          0.722|          0.768|
|13    |          0.098|          0.114|
|61    |          0.148|          0.081|
|146   |          0.032|          0.037|

The values did not change much, but they are more accurate, now.
