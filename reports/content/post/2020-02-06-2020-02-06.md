## Integration of comutation and genetic dependency analyses

To finish up the paper, I want to integrate the comutation and dependency analyses from earlier in the paper.

### Combined HINT and STRING PPIN

I used a combined PPI from STRING, HINT, and BioPlex2.
IT was created in "./munge/40_ppi-network-preparation.R".

I created some descriptive plots to provide a better understanding of the graph.

I plotted a graph showing many summary statistics of the components of the combined graph.
The overwhelming conclusion is that we can just use the main giant component.
Most of the other components range from sizes 1 to 10, so relatively insignificant.

Unsurprisingly, The degree distribution of the giant components is roughly log-normal.

## Overlap of comutation and genetic dependency analysis

I worked through "src/40_10_overlap-synlet-comutation.R" and updated it for the new nomenclature used in the paper.

I also added another section that just gets all overlaps from the two analyses.
There are only overlaps in LUAD G12C - no other alleles have genes found in both analyses.

For the paper, I will likely identify these genes and make some plot about them.
I can then isolate one of the PPIN clusters, do some summary analysis on it, reference some papers implicating it in cancer, etc., and finish the paper.
