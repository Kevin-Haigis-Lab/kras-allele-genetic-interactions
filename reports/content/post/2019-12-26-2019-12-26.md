## Plot PPI of enriched subnetworks

While writing, I thought it could be interesting to include a PPI of the genes underlying the enriched subnetworks.
I created the script "src/20_47_enriched-functions_signaling-pathways.R" to do this.
I have it working and am currently trying to get it to plot just enough nodes to be informative, but not overwhelming.
