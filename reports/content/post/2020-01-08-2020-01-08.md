## PAAD comutation figure

I began the creation of the main comutation figure for PAAD.

One panel has bar plots of the log(OR) for the comutation of *KRAS* alleles and a specific gene.
These were made for genes that have different comutation interactions with multiple alleles.
The script for making these plots for each cancer and saving `ggplot` objects for the figures is "src/20_41_disagreeing-interactions_logOR-barplot.R".
Below are bar plots for each gene that had these "conflicting" interactions in PAAD, though only *TP53*, *RNF43*, *MAP2K4*, and *RBM10* are used for the figure.
