## Analysis to remove genes that can confidently be removed

This was originally done in the old analysis structure, so can mainly be copied over to this directory system.

The HPA and GTEx data were moved from "/n/no_backup2/dbmi/park/jc604/databases/tissue_gene_expression/" to "data/tissue-gene-expression/".

A new munging script, "7_tissue-specific-genes.R", was created and contained the same data preparation steps.

The raw data tables were put on the ignore list because:

- they have a header that must be skipped
- they are not used for any other analysis


The TCGA and MMRF gene expression data was also moved to "data" in a subdirectory called "data/tcga/".
This was added to the ignore list for data.

The munging begins by organizing the GTEx, HPA, and TCGA data.
The MMRF data uses Ensembl gene IDs, so `org.Hs.eg.db` from Bioconductor was used to get the mappings to Hugo symbols.
The following was run to create a data frame mapping the Ensembl gene IDs to their Hugo symbols.
**It is not included in a munging script because I do not want all of the horrible Bioconductor nonsense in my Namespace.**

```r
cache("gene_name_tib", {
    suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(org.Hs.eg.db))
    gene_name_tib <- full_join(
            as_tibble(as.data.frame(org.Hs.egENSEMBL)),
            as_tibble(as.data.frame(org.Hs.egSYMBOL)),
            by = "gene_id"
        ) %>%
        dplyr::select(-gene_id) %>%
        filter(!is.na(ensembl_id) & !is.na(symbol))
    return(gene_name_tib)
})
gene_name_tib

### TODO

- I need to finish make the list of genes to ignore for each caner
- cache this list
- do some plotting of the genes
