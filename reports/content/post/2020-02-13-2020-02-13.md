## *STK11* lollipop plot

Yesterday, I created a lollipop plot of the mutations on *STK11*, separated by G12C and the rest of the samples.
Today, I tested for an enrichment of mutations at each location, but found nothing.
It is likely due to a lack of power at any individual amino acid position.
I did, however, add annotations for if the mutation is predicted to be damaging using SIFT, POLYPHEN, FATHMM, and known clinical significance.

Since there is nothing obviously different between the two groups, I will write something to the effect: 

> There is no apparent or statistically detectable difference in the types nor locations of mutations between G12C-mutant samples and the rest of the LUAD tumor samples.
> Thus, it is unlikely that the genetic associations found here were driven by latent mutational processes, but instead they were determined by the selective advantage that concomitant *KRAS* G12C and *STK11* mutations have in a tumor.
