## Analysis of GSEA results (cont.)

I created dot-plots that show which gene sets are enriched for each allele in each cancer.
They plots are available in "graphs/10_37_gsea-depmap-analysis/".

After looking at the results from just using the Hallmarks of Cancer gene set, I re-ran the GSEA to include the C2 Curated gene sets.
This took way too long, though, so I remake the script to run as a job-array.
For some reason, the 11th and final job (PAAD G12V) failed due to X11 errors.
The log is shown below:

```txt
slurmstepd: error: x11: job infos are invalid
slurmstepd: error: spank: required plugin x11.so: user_init() failed with rc=-
slurmstepd: error: spank_user failed.
slurmstepd: error: Unable to return to working directory
slurmstepd: error: job_manager exiting abnormally, rc = 4020
```

I just ran another job array with `--array=11-11` and it worked.

All jobs were successfully running by 2:15 pm.
From my notes the last time I ran GSEA suing Hallmark and C2 gene sets, this should take about 5 hours.


## Describing genes in clusters of simple model results

On 10/14, I created the heatmaps in "graphs/10_10_linear-modeling-syn-let_pheatmaps".
The genes were cut into clusters by eye.
I now want to use Enrichr to describe the genes in each cluster.
This analysis was conducted in "src/10_10_linear-modeling-syn-let.R" in the section "Functional annotation of heatmap gene (row) clusters".
Tables of the outputs are available in "tables/10_10_linear-modeling-syn-let"; two tables are available, one with all of the significant hits (adjusted q-value < 0.20) and one with the top 5 from each data source for each gene cluster.
This second table is also filtered for terms that are unique compared to the terms in the other clusters (ie. the term was only found for one cluster of genes).
A third table was created after removing some of the more common terms: "gene-clusters-fxnal-enrichment_uncommon.tsv".
