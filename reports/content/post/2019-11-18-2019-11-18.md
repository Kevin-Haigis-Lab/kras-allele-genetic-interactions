## API for maftools "lollipop" plots

I created my own API for using the `maftools::lollipopPlot()` and `maftools::lollipopPlot2()` functions.
I can create either for any gene in any *KRAS*-mutant samples for a specific cancer.
Now I just need to generate plots for mutations of genes in the desired *KRAS* mutants.

## Prioritize comutation hits for KH

KH is using the results of the increased comutation analysis in COAD for his RO1 resubmission.
However, he needs a way of prioritizing the hits to a more manageable number (<40).
One way to do this is to prioritize genes with mutations known or predicted to be oncogenic.
Therefore, I have parsed the results of ["3D clusters of somatic mutations in cancer reveal numerous rare mutations as functional targets"](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-016-0393-x#Sec22) (Gao *et al.*, 2017, PMID 28115009).
The parsed data frame is cached as `mutation_3d_hotspots`.

I decided to just make a file for the code used for KH's resubmission: "src/90_15_kh-resubmission.R".

To get information on the mutations, I needed to annotate the mutations.
This was accomplished using ANNOVAR and is implemented in two munge scripts,  "munge/23_annovar-annotation-mutations.R" and "munge/23_annovar-annotation-mutations.sh", where the latter is called within the former.

It was pretty late, so I set the ANNOVAR script to run and went to bed.
