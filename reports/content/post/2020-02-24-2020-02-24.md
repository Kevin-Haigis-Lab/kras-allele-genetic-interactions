## Rewrite last section of mutational signature portion of Results

I re-ordered the last section of the mutational signatures portion of the Results section in the manuscript.
The changes were pushed to GitHub.

While I was there, I also implemented GitHub actions to check the building of the $\LaTeX$ and added a README.

## Include G13D in LUAD DepMap analysis

For the LUAD portion of the DepMap analysis figure (Fig. 4), I included G13D in the GSEA results, but not in the gene-by-gene results - namely the heatmap.
KH thinks we might as well include it and let the reviewers decide if it should be removed for not be clinically relevant as there are few patients with the mutation.

The following code re-runs all of the downstream scripts affected by changed to the LUAD data.

```r
# Run the linear modeling and make box-plots and heatmaps
source("src/10_10_linear-modeling-syn-let.R")
source("src/10_11_syn-let_heatmaps-boxplots.R")

# Run the rest of the 10 series of scripts.
scripts_batch1 <- c(
    "10_13_linear-modeling-syn-let_fxnal-enrichment.R",
    "10_15_linear-modeling-syn-let_ppi-subnetworks.R",
    "10_17_linear-modeling-syn-let_specific-protein-types.R"
)
for (script in scripts_batch1) {
    source(file.path("src", script))
}

# Run the pertinent 40 series scripts.
scripts_batch2 <- c(
    "40_10_overlap-synlet-comutation.R",
    "40_12_overlap-synlet-comutation-hits.R",
    "40_20_comut-dependency-genes-ppi-connectivity.R"
)
for (script in scripts_batch2) {
    source(file.path("src", script))
}
```
