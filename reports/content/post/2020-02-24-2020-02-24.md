## Rewrite last section of mutational signature portion of Results

I re-ordered the last section of the mutational signatures portion of the Results section in the manuscript.
The changes were pushed to GitHub.

While I was there, I also implemented GitHub actions to check the building of the $\LaTeX$ and added a README.

## Include G13D in LUAD DepMap analysis

For the LUAD portion of the DepMap analysis figure (Fig. 4), I included G13D in the GSEA results, but not in the gene-by-gene results - namely the heatmap.
KH thinks we might as well include it and let the reviewers decide if it should be removed for not be clinically relevant as there are few patients with the mutation.

### Re-run analyses

The following code re-runs all of the downstream scripts affected by changed to the LUAD data.

```r
# Run the linear modeling and make box-plots and heatmaps
source("src/10_10_linear-modeling-syn-let.R")
source("src/10_11_syn-let_heatmaps-boxplots.R")

# Run the rest of the 10 series of scripts.
scripts_batch1 <- c(
    "10_13_linear-modeling-syn-let_fxnal-enrichment.R",
    "10_15_linear-modeling-syn-let_ppi-subnetworks.R",
    "10_17_linear-modeling-syn-let_specific-protein-types.R"
)
for (script in scripts_batch1) {
    source(file.path("src", script))
}

# Run the pertinent 40 series scripts.
scripts_batch2 <- c(
    "40_10_overlap-synlet-comutation.R",
    "40_12_overlap-synlet-comutation-hits.R",
    "40_20_comut-dependency-genes-ppi-connectivity.R"
)
for (script in scripts_batch2) {
    source(file.path("src", script))
}
```

### Update Figue 5

Along with many others, *STK11* was no longer considered to be differentially codependent with G12C, and thus Fig. 5b had to be removed.
Also, there are now only 3 genes that have comutation and dependency interactions with an allele.
Therefore, the table in Fig. 5a is much smaller.

I changed the first two panels in Fig. 5 to have the table, transposed with genes along the top, remaining in panel a.
Panels b, c, and d are now the comutation rainfall plots and depedendcy box-plots for the three genes in the table.

```
+-----+ +------------+ +------------+ +------------+
|     | |            | |            | |            |
|     | |            | |            | |            |
| tbl | |   gene A   | |   gene B   | |   gene C   |
|     | |            | |            | |            |
|     | |            | |            | |            |
+-----+ +------------+ +------------+ +------------+
```

However, the individual plots that would fill these panels do not look very interesting.
Thus, I need to figure something else out...
