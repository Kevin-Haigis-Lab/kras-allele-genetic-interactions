## Figure 2 v1 draft

I completed the first draft of Figure 2 version 1.
I then decided to do some writing to see if everything fit well together in a story.
I will be meeting with KH tomorrow to go over the progress.

### Notes while writing

- Make Supp. Figures 1 and 2.
- Change to Figure 1b: have two y-axes, one with total frequency for all samples (ie. including WT) and one with frequency of KRAS alleles (ie. no WT).
- My barplots of all samples signature levels is completely different from GM
    + This is especially obvious with my lack of a chunk of MSI in COAD.
