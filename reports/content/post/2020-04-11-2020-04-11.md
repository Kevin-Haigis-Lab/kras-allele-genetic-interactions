## Predicted vs. observed *KRAS* allele frequency using mutational signatures (v2)

### Approach

There are three matrices: 

$\textbf{A} = \lbrack \text{KRAS allele} \times \text{mutational signature} \rbrack$

$\textbf{B} = \lbrack \text{mutational signature} \times \text{tumor sample barcode} \rbrack$

$\textbf{C} = \textbf{A} \times \textbf{B} = \lbrack \text{KRAS allele} \times \text{tumor sample barcode} \rbrack$

Matrix **A** is the liklihood of each mutational signature causing each *KRAS* allele.
An additional row, `"remainder"`, was added to represent the portion of the mutational signature that doesn't cause a mutation to **KRAS**.

Matrix **B** is the contribution of each mutational signature to each tumor sample.

Matrix **C** is calculated by multiplying $\textbf{A} \times \textbf{B}$ and represents the probability of each mutational signature to cause a *KRAS* allele.
In this case, the `"remainder"` may be thought of as WT *KRAS*.

The "artifact" were removed at the beginning to remove their impact on the predicted frequency.

### Results

Most samples would be predicted to not have a *KRAS* mutation.
Only a handful of those that do have a *KRAS* mutation were predicted to have one.
Only one sample had the most likely *KRAS* mutation (A146T in MM).

Estimating the frequency of the KRAS alleles by assigning each sample the mutation it would most likely get from the mutational signatures resulted in horrible predictions.

Estimating the frequency of the *KRAS* alleles by taking the average likelihood over all samples and normalizing the values to sum to one produced better estimates.

### Adjustments

I will adjust the model to use all oncogenic alleles in every cancer, not only if it is found in that cancer.
This is because the null hypothesis is that any oncogenic *KRAS* allele should do and the mutational signature is making the decision.
