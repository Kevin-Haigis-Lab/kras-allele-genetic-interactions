## Haigis Lab presentation

I presented for the Haigis Lab meeting.
The PowerPoint is in "presentations/".
I got some good feedback and added the recommendations to "TODO.md".

## Confidence intervals for *KRAS* allele frequency

I bootstrapped 95% CI for the predictions on the *KRAS* allele frequencies.
The ["Quick-R: Bootstrapping"](https://www.statmethods.net/advstats/bootstrapping.html) article from DataCamp was a good resource for bootstrapping in R.

This analysis was added to "src/50_10_observed-predicted-kras-alleles.R".
The results are cached as `kras_allele_freq_bootstrap_ci`.
**TODO: I still need to add these values to the plots.**

## Additional PPI networks

OP suggested that I use additional PPI networks along with STRING to increase the confidence of the reported interactions.
With her help, I decided to use the following:
    - [BioPlex 2.0](https://bioplex.hms.harvard.edu/index.php)
    - [IntAct](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/)
    - [HINT](http://hint.yulab.org)
    - [STRING](https://string-db.org)

They were all downloaded to individual directories in "data/ppi-networks/":

```bash
# Move to directory for PPI networks.
cd data/ppi-networks

# Download BioPlex 2.0 network.
curl https://bioplex.hms.harvard.edu/data/BioPlex_interactionList_v4a.tsv \
  -o bioplex2/bioplex2.txt \
  --insecure

# Download IntAct network.

```
