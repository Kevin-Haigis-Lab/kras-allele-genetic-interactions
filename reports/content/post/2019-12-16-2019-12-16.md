# Plot of genes removed from expression filter

I created plots and Supp. Figure 3 to show the mutation frequency of genes removed due to low expression.
The analysis was done in "src/05_10_expression-filter-plots.R".

I tuned and turned the plots showing mutation burden per sample into a supplemental figure.
