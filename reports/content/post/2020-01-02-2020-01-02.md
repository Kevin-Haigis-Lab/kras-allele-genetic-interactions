## Analysis of comutation of known oncogenes in MM

The *KRAS* allele-specific comutation network was sparse and highly-disconnected.
Thus, I decided to look specifically at known oncogenes and tumor suppressors (TS) in the cancer.

The known oncogenes were, excluding *KRAS*, *NRAS*, *TP53*, *DIS3*, *FAM46C* *BRAF*, *TRAF3*, *PRDM1*, *CYLD*, *RB1*, *ACTG1*, *ATR*, *NBEA*, and *SOX21*.

### Comutation heatmap

I created a heatmap of the comutation frequency for the known oncogenes in MM.
Only alleles with more than 5 tumor samples were included.
The marginal values are shown: allele frequency across the top and mutation frequency of the genes along the side.
The heatmap is colored by the frequency of comutation.
The labels are the percent values with "-" indicating 0 %.
The bold values (4) are statistically significant genetic interactions; all were reduced comutation.

This plot was added to the Supplemental Figure of MM comutation alongside the labeled network.
