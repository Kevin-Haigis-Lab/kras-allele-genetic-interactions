## Comutation networks

### Rainfall plots for top interactions (cont.)

I started by getting `oncoplot()` and `oncostrip()` from ['maftools']() working.
The plots looked interesting so I continued this further to produce more customized plots.

I want to plot the waterfall oncoplots with KRAS separated into one allele against the others.
I want these two groups to be at the top of the order for the genes, so I needed to sort the genes myself.
In order to get this parameterization from `oncostrip()`, I needed to update 'maftools' which meant updated BioConductor to version 3.9.

After updating the BioConductor and all related packages, I finished creating the oncoplots for the alleles.
I made plots showing each allele and its mutually exclusive partners, separating the *KRAS* bar into the allele and "other".
Because I wanted to keep the allele and *KRAS* "other" as the top 2 rows in the plots, I had to implement my own sorting methods.

Below are some examples of the output.
They seem to demonstrate the concept very well - there is a clear reduced rate of mutation in the indicated genes compared to the other *KRAS*-mutant samples and *KRAS* WT samples.

### Notes for tomorrow

Use LDA on the DepMap data to separate the alleles.
What genes are the most descriptive of the new axes?
