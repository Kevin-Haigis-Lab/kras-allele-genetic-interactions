## Ranked plots for enriched gene sets

I added these new plots to the end of "src/10_37_gsea-depmap-analysis.R".
In order to get the data for more of the gene sets, I re-ran the GSEA and instructed it to save the reports for more of the top gene sets.


## KRAS allele distribution

I finished up the lollipop plot for the distribution of mutations along KRAS.

## Mutational signature distributions

I began remaking the bar plots of the distribution of mutational signatures.
These will be in the new Figure 1.
I prepared the mutational signature calling results from GM in "munge/55_mutational-signatures.R".
