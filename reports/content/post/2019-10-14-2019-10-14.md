## Summarizing current status of comutation analysis

Before continuing, it seemed reasonable to summarize the current status of the comutation and mutual exclusivity analysis.
This summary is located in [Comutation and Mutual Exclusivity]({{ project/comutation-and-mutual-exclusivity }}).

I changed the thresholds for the comutation and mutual exclusivity results in "src/20_35_rc-fisher-comparison.R" to be more strict because the numbers of interactions detected seemed unbelievably high.
I then re-ran all downstream analyses.

I fixed a bug in the dot-plots of the Enrichr results. 
If there were no 0 values, then the minimum number would be set to zero for the alpha and point size. 
Now, the minimum values for the alpha and point size are 0.1 and 1, respectively, if there are no zero values.
