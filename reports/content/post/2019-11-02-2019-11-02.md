## Fix modeling of the synthetic lethality

### Fixing data issues

The first thing to fix was to remove the EGFR-mutant samples from the *KRAS* WT.
Just like with *BRAF* and *NRAS*, though, I only removed cell lines with known activating mutations.

I took this as a good time to fix an issue with duplicated data.
The problem came from rows of the dependency table being copied during joins to other data frames.
I went through the munging scripts and found the few places where this was happening, fixing this issue.
(I also fixed some mistakes with gene name parsing.)

I removed all of the cached data and reloaded the project to build everything from scratch.

I reran the modeling and recreated the heatmaps and box-plots.

### Next steps

Below are the following next steps for this portion of the paper.

1. Conduct a similar analysis with the RNAi screen data.
    + Any overlapping genes should be highlighted in the paper.
2. Functional enrichment of the clusters.
3. See if there is any overlap with the comutation and mutually exclusive interactors.
4. Identify and highlight any "therapeutically viable" targets in the hits.
5. Are any of the hits considered "pan-essential" or "pan-nonessential" by DepMap?
6. See if any of the hits in the *a priori* genes of interest.
