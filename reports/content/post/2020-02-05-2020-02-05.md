## Genetic dependency of PAAD cell lines on *JUN* and *CDKN2A/B* (cont.)

Since it doesn't seem like the entire JNK signaling pathway is unilaterally less essential in G12V cell lines, I decided to look downstream of *JUN*.

### Transcription factor binding gene set

I downloaded the transcription factor gene set from the ENCODE project.

```bash
wget https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/static/hdfs/harmonizome/data/encodetfppi/gene_set_library_crisp.gmt.gz
gunzip gene_set_library_crisp.gmt.gz
 mv gene_set_library_crisp.gmt encode_transcription_factor_targets.gmt
```

It was then prepared for use in "munge/37_gene-list-preparation.R".

### Analysis

There were a few genes that cJUN regulates that showed differential genetic dependency in PAAD.
The box-plots of these genes are shown below.

Therefore, I looked for enrichment of cJUN-regulated genes in this set of genes, but no such enrichment was present.

Even those above the red dashed-line (representing p-value = 0.05) were not significant once the p-values were adjusted for MHT.
