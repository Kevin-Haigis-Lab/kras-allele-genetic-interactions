## Oncoplots

I completed making oncogenes for hand-selected genes.
The goal was to focus attention on interactions with notable genes or especially striking interactions.
(These plots are available in "graphs/20_50_rainfall-plots-select/".)

### COAD

A striking plot is of the comutation interactions with A146T in COAD.

The plot for G12D mutually exclusive interactions in COAD was impressive.

### LUAD

The plot for G12D in LUAD, though, shows a definite reduction in the rate of comutation with TP53.

### PAAD

Another interesting comutation event is found in PAAD between G12R and *RAF1* and *IRAK1*.
While the mutations are rare, in general, there is a definite enrichment for tumors with G12R.

Overall, there were a substantial number of interactions with *RYR* genes.
In PAAD, *RYR3* comutates with G12V and *RYR1* is mutually exclusive with G12V.

Some of the most interesting and striking results were from the PAAD Q61H plots.
Below are some of the mutually exclusive interactions.

The plot below shows the strong comutation interaction with TP53.

I then made oncoplots of the genes in the *a priori* gene lists.
These accompany the genetic subnetworks from the *a priori* gene sets.
(These plots are available in "graphs/20_50_rainfall-plots-apriori/".)
They don't generally show anything different than in the above selection.

## Distribution of mutations per sample across cancers

We will want to include the distribution of mutational burden in our tumor samples as a supplemental figure for the paper.
These plots were made in "src/90_03_mutation-burden-distribution.R" and were saved to "graphs/90_03_mutation-burden-distribution/".
For each plot shown below, the top is of all mutations and bottom is of coding mutations.
For COAD, the hypermutants have an "x" shape.

I also made plots showing the distribution of the types of mutation found in each samples from each data source.

![](/img/graphs/90_03_mutation-burden-distribution/LUAD_mutation_types.svg)

![](/img/graphs/90_03_mutation-burden-distribution/MM_mutation_types.svg)

![](/img/graphs/90_03_mutation-burden-distribution/PAAD_mutation_types.svg)

![](/img/graphs/90_03_mutation-burden-distribution/SKCM_mutation_types.svg)

(I had to return to the munging of the mutation data from GM to standardize the types of mutation in the `mutation_type` column - I created a new column `mutation_type_hr` where "hr" stands for "human-readable".)
