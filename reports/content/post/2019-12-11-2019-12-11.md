# Genetic interaction graphs

I added an additional filter to the genetic interactions that allows for lower-frequency mutations to pass if they have a high rate of comutation with an allele.

I updated all downstream results.


## Figure 2

I worked on Figure 2, mainly making adjustments to the networks and oncoplots.

I also worked on the method for getting a selection of the enriched functions.
