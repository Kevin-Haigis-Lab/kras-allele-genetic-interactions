I have used the ['ProjectTemplate'](http://projecttemplate.net/index.html) R package to build the framework for the analysis. I created a lab notebook in reports using the ['blogdown'](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package which serves the site to the 'docs/' directory.

The remote repository is hosted by GitHub at [jhrcook/comutation](https://github.com/jhrcook/comutation) and is private. The lab notebook is hosted by Netlify and is located at [project-notebook-comutation.netlify.com](https://project-notebook-comutation.netlify.com). It is open to the public, but is not easily found.

I have trimmed down the default academic hugo theme to only include the sections About, Posts, and Contact.
