## Abstraction of EnrichR results

### Prepare data base gene sets

I needed the full gene sets used by Enrichr.
They were downloaded manually from the Enrichr ["Libraries"](https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/#stats) tab to "data/enrichr-gene-sets/".
They are prepared into a tidy data frame in "munge/60_enrichr-gene-sets.R".

### Bar-plots of comutation of enriched functional groups

I created bar-plots to show the frequency of comutation of the genes in the enriched functions.
For each enriched function, I found the rate of comutation of the underlying genes in the *KRAS* allele and the rest of the samples.
Further, I separated the genes that have increased from those with reduced comutation.
Below is an example of one such bar-plot for LUAD G12C with the gene sets from KEGG.
