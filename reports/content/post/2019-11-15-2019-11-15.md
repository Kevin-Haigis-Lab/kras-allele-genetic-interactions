## Add bootstrapped 95% CI to predicted KRAS allele frequency

I added the bootstrapped 95% CI as error bars to the bar plots and as line ranges to the scatter plots.
Here are the results for "any-hotspot" null hypothesis.

## Preparing additional PPI networks

I added the steps for downloading all of the PPI networks to [yesterday's notebook]({{< ref "/post/2019-11-14-2019-11-14.md" >}}).

When trying to parse the IntAct data, it was very difficult to see a scalable method. 
I will talk to OP and see what she recommends and how she uses IntAct.

I prepared both BioPlex2 and HINT PPI networks as `tidygraph` objects and cached them as `bioplex_gr` and `hint_gr`.
Below are some summary statistics of the graphs (the data is stored in a cached data frame `ppi_graph_summary_stats`).

| Metric          | STRING | BioPlex2 | HINT |
|-----------------|--------|----------|--------|
| num_edges       | 19354  | 10961    | 15674  |
| num_vertices    | 725882 | 56553    | 179332 |
| num_multiple    | 725882 | 0        | 26413  |
| diameter        | 14     | 11       | 9      |
| num_max_cliques | 210988 | 46073    | 145594 |
| mean_distance   | 3.79   | 4.28     | 3.47   |
| transitivity    | 0.536  | 0.0605   | 0.0823 |

## Analysis of PPI subnetworks from hits of comutation and dependency

I began the deeper analysis of the PPI subnetworks by incorporating  multiple subnetworks (as shown above).
The number of data sources that support the presence of an interaction is shown by the weight of the edge in the network.

I then used simulated annealing to identify clusters within the subnetworks.
This likely most useful for very busy, "hairball" subnetworks, such as for LUAD G12C.
Below is the full subnetwork for LUAD G12C that includes *KRAS*

and the following are some of the extracted clusters.
