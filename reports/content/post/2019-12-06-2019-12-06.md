## Re-make plots from new GSEA run

I re-ran the script that makes the plots from the GSEA results.
I will look through the results, later.

## Re-make plots for predicting *KRAS* allele from mutational signatures

I remade the plots for the prediction of the *KRAS* allele frequency by the mutational signatures, this time, only using alleles for each cancer that are the most prevalent.
The general conclusion is that the mutational signatures are poor predictors of allele frequency.
Where the p-value of the binomial test is greater than 0.05, the 95% CI bars are massive.
Therefore, the lack of significant difference from the predicted frequency is likely due to a large amount of variation rather than accuracy of the prediction.

## Plot the probability that the mutations from a mutational signature created the observed *KRAS* allele
