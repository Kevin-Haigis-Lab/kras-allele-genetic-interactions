## Comparing results for alleles across cancer

Analysis done in "src/40_50_comparing-alleles-across-cancer.R".

### Same genetic dependencies across cancers

I first looked at whether there were genes that an allele had a genetic dependency interaction with in multiple cancers but didn't find anything.
Below is a table of the genes that passed the ANOVA test in multiple cancers and had at least one pairwise BH-adj. p-value < 0.05.

##  *KRAS* G13D is not a driver mutation in LUAD

The problems with finishing the paper arose when we included the *KRAS* G13D cell lines in the genetic dependency analysis for LUAD.
They were originally excluded because they are an uncommon allele in the cancer and, thus, are not biologically relevant.
However, KH recommended that we include them and let the reviewers make that decision.

Including these 3 cell lines in the analysis effectively diluted out a lot of the previous results (by adding another covariate to the linear model).
Consequently, many of the results for the end of the paper were no longer true, and a new ending to the paper had to be found.

However, I realized that a more conclusive way of testing if we should include the G13D cell lines was to look at the effect of knocking out *KRAS* in each cell line.
The results are below and clearly show that the effect of knocking out *KRAS* G13D in LUAD cell lines had the equivalent result of knocking out WT *KRAS*.

I will check with KH this afternoon, though I think he will agree that this means we should exlude these samples again.
If so, I can revert the end of the paper to what is was before.
