## Survival analysis (cont.)

### General cancer survival analysis

I finished the general cancer survival analysis.
There weren't any terribly new findings on top of those reported yesterday.

### Comutation survival analysis

I ran two tests so far and have the third and fourth planned for tomorrow:

* for samples with a specific *KRAS* allele: `survival ~ comutation`
* for all samples: `survival ~ krasallele + comutation`
* for samples with mutant *KRAS*: `survival ~ krasallele + comutation`
* for samples with a specific *KRAS* allele or WT *KRAS*: `survival ~ krasallele + comutation`

The first analysis returned a few curves with significant differences.
Below I am showing some where the pattern of the survival curve matches what we would expect from the genetic interaction.

The second analysis return a few interesting results, too.
Annoyingly, I think only the genes with enough tumor samples so have all four curves on the plot are meaningful.
This reduces the number of genes to analyze.
Some are shown below.

Some follow the survival trend that we would expect from the comutation interaction.
Some go against it, however.
One hypothesis could be that they are mutually exclusive due to collateral lethality, but another mutation can rescue the lethality, resulting in a very powerful tumor.

*TGFBR2* has reduced comutation with two *KRAS* alleles, though has simillar effects on the survival curves.
I should look into if these are other *KRAS* mutant samples suggesting G12D and Q61H are not really helped by mutation to *TGFBR2*.

The survival curves for comutation with *TP53* between G12D and G12V were interesting.

From the comutation analysis, G12D had increased rates of comutation with *TP53* while G12V had reduced rates of comutation.

For G12D, the curves with of samples with G12D with or without *TP53* looked the same, while *TP53* without G12D was intermediate to with G12D samples and without either mutation.
For G12V, The *TP53* alone or with G12V curves were the same while the G12V only curve was far less severe (i.e. better overall survival) than the other three curves.

What is suprising is that the comutation curve of G12V and *TP53* is more severe than the G12V only curve.
**However, this could suggest that the G12V mutation is redundant for the *TP53* mutation.**
