## Analysis to remove genes that can confidently be removed (cont.)

I finished up making `confidently_unexpressed_genes` (cached).
I then returned to the munging script for  preparing the model data and removed the genes were are confident are not expressed in the normal or tumor.

## Linear modeling allele-specificity

### Linear Model 1

The first model I tried was a simple linear model (using `lm()`) of the following form.

```txt
  gene_effect ~ allele + is_altered + rna_scaled
```

It attempts the use the *KRAS* allele, 
A step-wise feature selection AIC-based method was applied to each model.

**Other thoughts**

Latent variable analysis of DepMap data.
Regress on the depletion effect of each gene for a patient.
The latent variables are signaling pathway.
Results show which pathways are most important.
But will I just pull out the essential pathways?
The goal of the DepMap analysis is to find lethals.

So instead for each gene, have features be mutational status, RNA expression, CNA of other genes (each feature of each gene linked to each other). Latent variables are pathways.
