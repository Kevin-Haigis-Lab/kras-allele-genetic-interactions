## Comparing results from Fisher's test and RC-test

Looking at GM's figure 3, I'm not sure how he has such a sparse figure for PAAD. From his results, there should be a lot of genes for KRAS G12D (> 800) at even a p-value cut-off of 0.01.

From yesterday's conclusion to use the Fisher's exact test for comutation and the RC-test for mutual exclusivity, I created a combined data frame with both of these data for future use: `genetic_interaction_df`.


## Analysis of hits from genetic interaction tests

This analysis was conducted in "src/20_40_genetic-interaction-hits.R".

For a first pass, I just identified genes that might be of interest by using curated lists:

- the following KEGG gene sets (from [MSigDB](http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/downloads.jsp)): 
- the interactors with WT KRAS from [Kovalski *et al.*, 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=30639242)
- and the [COSMIC Cancer Gene Consensus](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census)

### Gene list preparation

These files were all parsed and cached in "munge/37_gene-list-preparation.R"

The BioID data was available in an Excel spreadsheet with merged cells.
Therefore, it was difficult to read in and prepare as-is.
I manually removed the annoying cells in a new file "Kovalski-et-al-2019_BioID_REFORMATTED.xlsx"

The resulting files are:

- `cosmic_cgc_df`
- `kegg_geneset_df`
- `kras_interactors_bioid_df`
- `genes_of_interest_df` (a collation of the genes and their sources)


### Overlap

Looking at each cancer, there is a good amount of overlap between the genetic interactions and the *a priori* genes of interest.

| Cancer | num. genes |
|--------|------------|
| COAD   | 108        |
| LUAD   | 218        |
| MM     | 15         |
| PAAD   | 295        |

To see these genes in relation to each other, I imported the STRING pathway and selected just the proteins found in the overlap.

The STRING data base was downloaded on 2019-09-20 and all the original files are in my data base directory "/n/no_backup2/dbmi/park/jc604/databases/networks/STRING/".
The preparation was done in "munge/40_STRING-network-preparation.R".

During this analysis, I decided to stop because the computation was taking too long and the output was unlikely to be interesting.
I will revisit this analysis, but I first want to deal with the zoomed-out view of comparing the results of the alleles.

## High-level genetic interaction figures

This analysis was conducted in "src/20_40_highlivel-genetic-interactions.R".

I began work on the genetic interaction figures with the Fisher's exact test used for comutation and the RC-test used for mutual exclusivity.
I employed UpSet plots (using UpSetR) to visualize the overlap of the comutation and mutual exclusive interactions.
As Joe stated, the UpSet plot is essentially a higher-dimensional Venn diagram.

(The following plots do not have titles because there is no parameter for adding one in UpSetR...)

### COAD

**Comutation**

**Mutually Exclusive**

### LUAD

**Comutation**

**Mutually Exclusive**

### MM

**Comutation**

**Mutually Exclusive**

### PAAD

**Comutation**

**Mutually Exclusive**

I also re-created the genetic interaction network plots.
This time, however, I did not include the names all of genes, but instead use the plot to demonstrate higher-level trends.

### COAD

Many of the alleles are connected by shared mutually-exclusive interactions and have their own "clouds" of comutation interactions.
This can be seen very clearly between G12D and G12V.

Interestingly, Q61K and Q61L seem to be quite similar.

### LUAD

There is a lot of overlap of mutually exclusive interactions between G12C and G12V.
These alleles are both driven by smoke, but I can't think of an explanation why this would drive mutual exclusivity.

### MM

The allele-specific genetic interactions are very sparse, possibly speaking to the large distribution of *KRAS* alleles found in the diease.
This may indicate that the allele is not as impactful in MM as it is in COAD, LUAD, and PAAD.

There are a few mutually exclusive partners shared by a few alleles.

### PAAD

There are a lot of significant interactions here.
Interestingly (worryingly?) I report here many(!) more comutation interactions than GM does in his figure even though we are use the same results.
Even if I reduce the p-value cutoff to 0.01, I report at least an order of magnitude more interactions that GM.
I definitely need to get to the bottom of this...

## Final notes

- I need to look into why there is such a large discrepancy between my and GM's figures, especially for PAAD.
- It appears that there are some genes that comutate with one allele and are mutually exclusive with another. These may be interesting to look further into.
- Not all of the alleles are appearing in the UpSet plots. I have added a note to the code to fix this.
