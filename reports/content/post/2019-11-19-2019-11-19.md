## Prioritize comutation hits for KH (cont.)

I finished up preparing the mutation annotation from ANNOVAR and merged it back with `cancer_coding_muts_df` to make a new cached data frame `cancer_coding_av_muts_df`.

To limit the number of genes used in the screen, I filtered by the strength of the consensus on the likelihood of a mutation being damaging over several algorithms.
The final figure is below.
There were 42 unique genes in the final figure.

## Manuscript

I began working through the manuscript with the hope of eventually seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.

I changed the lollipop plot that GM made to a small one that just shows the distribution of mutations across alleles.

A table for the allele distributions across all cancers is available at "tables/90_05_kras-allele-distribution/kras-allele-distribution.tsv".
A table for the codon distributions across all cancers is available at "tables/90_05_kras-allele-distribution/kras-codon-distribution.tsv".
A table for the codon distribution with all cancers combined is available at "tables/90_05_kras-allele-distribution/kras-codon-distribution-allcancers.tsv".
