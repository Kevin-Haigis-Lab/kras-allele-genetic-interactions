         for the exploration and annotation of genetic variants. Capabilities
         exist for reading, writing and filtering variant call format (VCF)

         Bioconductor facilities for advanced statistical analysis, data
         transformation, visualization and integration with diverse genomic
         resources. Availability and implementation: This package is
         implemented in R and available for download at the Bioconductor Web
         site
         (http://bioconductor.org/packages/2.13/bioc/html/VariantAnnotation.html).
         The package contains extensive help pages for individual functions and
         a 'vignette' outlining typical work flows; it is made available under
         the open source 'Artistic-2.0' license. Version 1.9.38 was used in
