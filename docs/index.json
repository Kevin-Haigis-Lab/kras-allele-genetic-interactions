From his results, there should be a lot of genes for KRAS G12D (\u0026gt; 800) at even a p-value cut-off of 0.01.\nFrom yesterday\u0026rsquo;s conclusion to use the Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test for comutation and the RC-test for mutual exclusivity, I created a combined data frame with both of these data for future use: genetic_interaction_df.\nAnalysis of hits from genetic interaction tests This analysis was conducted in \u0026ldquo;src/20_40_genetic-interaction-hits.R\u0026rdquo;.\nFor a first pass, I just identified genes that might be of interest by using curated lists:\n the following KEGG gene sets (from MSigDB): the interactors with WT KRAS from Kovalski et al., 2019 and the COSMIC Cancer Gene Consensus  Gene list preparation These files were all parsed and cached in \u0026ldquo;munge/37_gene-list-preparation.R\u0026rdquo;\nThe BioID data was available in an Excel spreadsheet with merged cells. Therefore, it was difficult to read in and prepare as-is. I manually removed the annoying cells in a new file \u0026ldquo;Kovalski-et-al-2019_BioID_REFORMATTED.xlsx\u0026rdquo;\nThe resulting files are:\n cosmic_cgc_df kegg_geneset_df kras_interactors_bioid_df genes_of_interest_df (a collation of the genes and their sources)  Overlap Looking at each cancer, there is a good amount of overlap between the genetic interactions and the a priori genes of interest.\n   Cancer num. genes     COAD 108   LUAD 218   MM 15   PAAD 295    To see these genes in relation to each other, I imported the STRING pathway and selected just the proteins found in the overlap.\nThe STRING data base was downloaded on 2019-09-20 and all the original files are in my data base directory \u0026ldquo;/n/no_backup2/dbmi/park/jc604/databases/networks/STRING/\u0026ldquo;. The preparation was done in \u0026ldquo;munge/40_STRING-network-preparation.R\u0026rdquo;.\nDuring this analysis, I decided to stop because the computation was taking too long and the output was unlikely to be interesting. I will revisit this analysis, but I first want to deal with the zoomed-out view of comparing the results of the alleles.\nHigh-level genetic interaction figures This analysis was conducted in \u0026ldquo;src/20_40_highlivel-genetic-interactions.R\u0026rdquo;.\nI began work on the genetic interaction figures with the Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test used for comutation and the RC-test used for mutual exclusivity. I employed UpSet plots (using UpSetR) to visualize the overlap of the comutation and mutual exclusive interactions. As Joe stated, the UpSet plot is essentially a higher-dimensional Venn diagram.\n(The following plots do not have titles because there is no parameter for adding one in UpSetR\u0026hellip;)\nCOAD Comutation\nMutually Exclusive\nLUAD Comutation\nMutually Exclusive\nMM Comutation\nMutually Exclusive\nPAAD Comutation\nMutually Exclusive\nI also re-created the genetic interaction network plots. This time, however, I did not include the names all of genes, but instead use the plot to demonstrate higher-level trends.\nCOAD Many of the alleles are connected by shared mutually-exclusive interactions and have their own \u0026ldquo;clouds\u0026rdquo; of comutation interactions. This can be seen very clearly between G12D and G12V.\nInterestingly, Q61K and Q61L seem to be quite similar.\nLUAD There is a lot of overlap of mutually exclusive interactions between G12C and G12V. These alleles are both driven by smoke, but I can\u0026rsquo;t think of an explanation why this would drive mutual exclusivity.\nMM The allele-specific genetic interactions are very sparse, possibly speaking to the large distribution of KRAS alleles found in the diease. This may indicate that the allele is not as impactful in MM as it is in COAD, LUAD, and PAAD.\nThere are a few mutually exclusive partners shared by a few alleles.\nPAAD There are a lot of significant interactions here. Interestingly (worryingly?) I report here many(!) more comutation interactions than GM does in his figure even though we are use the same results. Even if I reduce the p-value cutoff to 0.01, I report at least an order of magnitude more interactions that GM. I definitely need to get to the bottom of this\u0026hellip;\nFinal notes  I need to look into why there is such a large discrepancy between my and GM\u0026rsquo;s figures, especially for PAAD. It appears that there are some genes that comutate with one allele and are mutually exclusive with another. These may be interesting to look further into. Not all of the alleles are appearing in the UpSet plots. I have added a note to the code to fix this.

Comutation would occur when the additional mutation enhances the growth phenotype of the tumor. And example of this would be KRAS, TP53, and CDKN2A in PAAD. On the other hand, another gene and KRAS would mutate in a mutually exclusive pattern because doing so leads to a reduction in growth. A very strong example of this is the mutually exclusive activation mutations in BRAF and KRAS.\nAnalysis Comutation To study comutation, we conducted a one-sided Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test for association between each KRAS allele and all other genes.\nMutual Exclusivity The Row-Column test for mutual exclusivity (the \u0026ldquo;RC-test\u0026rdquo;) was developed by the Raphael Lab in 2016 and described in A weighted exact test for mutually exclusive mutations in cancer (Leiserson et al., 2016). The software supplied with the paper searched for any groups of genes demonstrating mutually exclusive relationships, but took far too long to compute over all of our samples. Therefore, I implemented the RC-test in my own R package (in dev, WeXT) and used Snakemake to orchestrate the runs on O2 in parallel. Again, the test was run between each KRAS allele and all other genes.\nHigh-level visualization To provide a higher-level visualization of the results, the genetic interactions were displayed as a network. These are meant to be interpreted as \u0026ldquo;clouds\u0026rdquo; where the density of the cloud provides an idea of the number of interactions.\nI also created UpSet plots to show the size and overlap of the sets. These can be interpreted as high-dimensional Venn diagrams.\nAnalysis of biological properties of the genetic interactors I used a priori gene lists to identify any genes of interest that have detectable genetic interactions with the KRAS alleles. The lists were notable KEGG pathways, the physical interactors of KRAS from a BioID experiment conducted in Kovalski et al., 2019, and the COSMIC Cancer Gene Consensus.\nI also used Enrichr (Chen et al., 2013) to identify gene sets enriched in the interactors for each KRAS allele.\nResults The following figure shows the number of genes with a genetic interaction that was detected for each KRAS allele. For comutation, there had to be at least 3 comutation events to be included. For mutual exclusivity, the other gene had to be mutated at least 10 times in the cancer. For both tests, a p-value of 0.01 was used for the declaration of statistical significance.\nThe plot shows that the number of detectable interactions increases with the number of samples, as expected.\nThe rest of the summary is subdivided by cancer.\nCOAD\nLUAD\nMM\nPAAD\nCOAD Below are the high-level visualizations of the genetic interactions. The alleles tend to be connected by mutual exclusive interactions (instead of comutation interactions). Each allele also has their own set of comutation and mutually exclusive interactors.\nThe network below shows all of the interactions with genes in the a priori lists. As expected, BRAF is strongly mutually exclusive with many of the alleles and PIK3CA and APC comutate with several alleles, too. Surprisingly, G12D and G13D are mutually exclusive with TP53. A146T has two interesting comutation interactions with PORCN and MAP3K1. G12V has a very strong comutation interaction with SMAD4. G12C has a strong comutation interaction with RAPGEF2. G12S (bottom left) has a comutation interaction with SMAD3.\nThe KEGG pathway gene set was very informative. Notably, G13D was enriched for the mTOR pathway, including RICTOR as shown in the above network. The genes with interactions with G12D are enriched in adhesion pathways (\u0026ldquo;Regulation of actin cytoskeleton\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Focal adhesion\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Leukocyte TEM\u0026rdquo;), possibly linked to the enrichment for the Rap1 signaling pathway. Many of the alleles have interactions with genes involved in ERBB signaling.\nAlso of note, but not shown graphically here, the physical interactors of SMAD2, a transcription factor, were found to be enriched in the G12D genetic interactors by two different gene sets.\nLUAD Below are the high-level visualizations of the genetic interactions. The alleles tend to be connected by mutual exclusive interactions (instead of comutation interactions). This is especially true for G12C, G12V, and G12D. Each allele also has their own set of comutation and mutually exclusive interactors. There are many genes that are mutually exclusive with one allele and comutate with another.\nThe genetic interaction networks with genes in the a prior lists are divided in to the KEGG pathways (top) and the CGC (bottom). There are very strong mutually exclusive relationships between EGFR, BRAF, and TP53, as expected. Also, there is a strong comutation interaction between G12C and STK11. In the CGC network, it appears that G12C is mutually exclusive with CTNNB1 ($\\beta$-catenin). G12C also is mutually exclusive with three different genes involved in voltage-gated calcium channels. G12C is mutually exclusive with JAG2 and comutates with NOTCH1 suggesting a special relationship with the Notch signaling pathway. The three alleles linked to the smoking mutational signature, G12A/C/V, and Q61L have strong comutation interactions with ATM. There are several comutation interactions that are unexpected, namely between G12D and G12R with NKX2-1, Homeobox protein Nkx-2.1. This gene is a \u0026ldquo;transcription factor that binds and activates the promoter of thyroid specific genes,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;may play a role in lung development and surfactant homeostasis,\u0026rdquo; (UniProt P43699). Another interesting relationship is that KRAP1 comutates with G13D and G13C, but is mutually exclusive with G12V and G12C. This could indicate an codon-specific property of hyperactivated KRAS in LUAD.\nThe results of an enrichment analysis using a gene set of PPI hub proteins are shown first. The physical interactors with $\\beta$-catenin and SMARC4 are enriched in the interactors of G12C. The interactors of PKC-$\\alpha$ (gene PKRCA) are enriched in G12V genetic interactions. PKC-$\\alpha$ is a \u0026ldquo;calcium-activated, phospholipid- and diacylglycerol (DAG)-dependent serine/threonine-protein kinase that is involved in positive and negative regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, migration and adhesion, tumorigenesis, cardiac hypertrophy, angiogenesis, platelet function and inflammation, by directly phosphorylating targets such as RAF1, BCL2, CSPG4, TNNT2/CTNT, or activating signaling cascade involving MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2) and RAP1GAP,\u0026rdquo; (UniProt P17252).\nThe results of an enrichment analysis using a gene set of GO Biological Processes are shown below. G12A seems to have an enrichment for genes involved in P53-mediated cell cycle arrest. There are several Ras-related processes enriched in the G12C interactors.\nMM Below are the high-level visualizations of the genetic interactions. There were not very many hits for multiple myeloma and very little overlap of the interacting genes between KRAS alleles.\nBelow is the network of genetic interactions for genes in the a priori lists. There is a detectable mutually exclusive interaction between Q61H and BRAF, though it is documented that MM can be highly multi-clonal. Therefore, there are often subpopulations of KRAS mutants and BRAF mutants within a single disease. This is likely true for KRAS and other genes, making the interpretation of these results difficult.\nThere was little evidence for functional enrichment in these genes.\nPAAD Below are the high-level visualizations of the genetic interactions. There were many allele-specific comutation and mutually exclusive interactions detected in PAAD. Further or more strict thresholds may be applied in future analyses to reduce false-positives.\nBelow are the interaction networks for genes in the a priori gene lists.\nThe first is of genes found to directly interact with KRAS in the CGC. Along with BRAF, there were some unexpected genes found to be mutually exclusive with multiple alleles. Interestingly, RNF43 was foound to be mutually exclusive with G12R, but comutates with G12D. RNF43 is \u0026ldquo;E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that acts as a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway by mediating the \u0026hellip; degradation of \u0026hellip; Frizzled,\u0026rdquo; (UniProt Q68DV7). In addition, TP53 is mutually exclusive with G12V, but comutates with Q61H and G12D. This is interesting because of the general perception that both KRAS and TP53 mutations are quintessential steps of PAAD progression. SMARCA4 is strongly mutually exclusive with G12R.\nThe following is the network of genetic interactions with genes found to directly interact with KRAS. One of the strongest interactions is between G12V and ATP2B1, the protein product of which helps regulate intracellular calcium levels at the plasma membrane. Another strong interaction is the mutually exclusive relationship between G12D and NF1. The obvious mechanism to propose for this is the same as that for BRAF.\nThe next genetic network is of the genes from select KEGG pathways. An interaction that really pops out is the strong comutation between Q61K and MAP3K13 and compared to the mutually exclusive relationships between G12V and G12R and the same gene. A similar case of conflicting interactions is found with MAP2K4 where it comutates with Q61R and is mutually exclusive with G12D. G12D strongly comutates with TGFBR2 - this transmembrane S/T-kinase activates SMAD2/4 when it binds with the cytokines TGFB1/2/3 (UniProt P37173). JAG2 is found to comutate with G12R, yet is mutually exclusive with G12V.\nTwo gene sets with interesting results from the enrichment analysis are shown below. The top is of kinases whose substrates are overrepresented in the associations, and the bottom is of Panther pathways.\nThere are a lot of substrates for the kinase PKA C-$\\alpha$ (gene PRKACA) that have genetic interactions with G12D and G12V. This kinase is involved in many cellular functions including Hedgehog and NF$\\kappa$B signaling. The substrates of Akt1 are also overrepresented in the genes with genetic interactions with G12D.\nMany genes involved in Wnt signaling have genetic interactions with several alleles. Genes of the EGFR pathway have many interactions with G12D.\n","date":1570618689,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1570618689,"objectID":"696696eb53b5eb218f5299cab72e8b92","permalink":"https://project-notebook-comutation.netlify.com/project/comutation-and-mutual-exclusivity/","publishdate":"2019-10-09T06:58:09-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/comutation-and-mutual-exclusivity/","section":"project","summary":"Testing for genetic interactions in human tumor samples based on their mutational patterns.","tags":["comutation","KRAS"],"title":"Comutation and Mutual Exclusivity","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Finish preparing RC-test results The final step was to merge the actual mutation numbers for each gene to the results from the RC-test.\nThese new values were used to update the plots made in \u0026ldquo;20_30_rc-test-results-analysis.R\u0026rdquo; (also shown in the notebook for 2019-10-07).\nGeneral scope of results Below is the number of significant interactions (p-value \u0026lt; 0.05 and at-least 3 events) per cancer found by the RC-test.\nThe plot below separates the bars by the type of interaction.\nInteraction networks Munge Fisher\u0026rsquo;s test for comutation results To compare against the RC test, I prepared the results from GM\u0026rsquo;s test for comutation (a Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test).

I need to merge in the number of mutation events in order to remove the genetic interactions that do not meet a low standard. For comutation, there should be at least 2 co-mutation events. For mutual exclusivity, the other gene should be mutated in at least 0.01% of all the cancer\u0026rsquo;s samples. This will remove a lot of mutually exclusive events that are caused by the mutation just being very rare.\nI will then compare the results to those from the Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test:\n How many genes are shared by each allele between the two analyses (Venn diagram for each allele) For the shared genes, how do the p-values compare (scatter plot with x and y-axis as p-value from each analysis; a line for $y = x$)  Finally, I will look for interesting results in the significant genes. This will start with highlight CGC genes. Also those found from the BioID screen of KRAS and KRAS mutants. Lastly, I will use WebGestalt, EnrichR, or PANTHER (PMID: 23868073 for updated overview) to find functional patterns in the gene lists.\nFor the paper, I see the text reading something to the effect of, \u0026ldquo;X tended to comutate with KRAS A and B but no interaction was detected for KRAS C nor D,\u0026rdquo; for individual CGC genes.

Once I have completed that to a satisfactory degree, I will look for overlap between the hits from each analysis.\nAllele-specific synthetic lethality So far, I have only completed the simplest possible analysis to find allele-specific synthetic lethality. Briefly, I removed the genes that could be explained by their RNA expression. Then, I conducted an ANOVA and pair-wise comparisons to find differences in lethality between cells with the various KRAS alleles, including WT. Some of the most interesting results can be found on yesterday\u0026rsquo;s notebook, and all plots are available in \u0026ldquo;graphs/10_10_linear-modeling-syn-let_bosplots/\u0026ldquo;.\nI want a way of visualizing all of these results (especially for the meeting with KH and PJP). The obvious way is to produce a heatmap of patient vs. gene with the genes that were found to have a significant difference. Then, I could show specific box-plots for genes of interest (CGC, KRAS interactors from BioID screen, specific KEGG pathways).\nAnother approach could be to look for enriched biological processes/pathways. To this end, we could employ an analysis similar to GSEA. We could run GSEA as one KRAS allele against all other cell lines or just the KRAS WT cell lines. I will also look into GSVA and ssGSEA, two popular variants of GSEA.\nA quick analysis that could be very fruitful is to conduct a PCA on the gene-space and see if the cell lines cluster by KRAS allele. If they do, that would lend credence to our claim that the KRAS allele is important. (It may be useful to plot the first few PCs using tSNE or UMAP.) If there appear to be clusters, then some sort of clustering (K-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, spectral clustering, etc.) could be used to make the claim concrete. Even just a difference between KRAS and WT would be supportive of our claim.\nLASSO of KRAS WT vs mutant starting with all genes as covariates.

Does not cleave \u0026lsquo;Lys-48\u0026rsquo;-linked polyubiquitin chains (By similarity). Plays a role in signal transduction for cell growth and MYC induction mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF. Potentiates BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) signaling by antagonizing the inhibitory action of SMAD6 and SMAD7. Has a key role in regulation of cell surface receptor-mediated endocytosis and ubiquitin-dependent sorting of receptors to lysosomes. Endosomal localization of STAMBP is required for efficient EGFR degradation but not for its internalization (By similarity). Involved in the negative regulation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR and RAS-MAP signaling pathways.\n PAAD From UniProt: EGLN2_HUMAN:\n Cellular oxygen sensor that catalyzes, under normoxic conditions, the post-translational formation of 4-hydroxyproline in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha proteins. Hydroxylates a specific proline found in each of the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domains (N-terminal, NODD, and C-terminal, CODD) of HIF1A. Also hydroxylates HIF2A\u0026hellip; Hydroxylated HIFs are then targeted for proteasomal degradation via the von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitination complex. Under hypoxic conditions, the hydroxylation reaction is attenuated allowing HIFs to escape degradation resulting in their translocation to the nucleus, heterodimerization with HIF1B, and increased expression of hypoxy-inducible genes. EGLN2 is involved in regulating hypoxia tolerance and apoptosis in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Also regulates susceptibility to normoxic oxidative neuronal death. Links oxygen sensing to cell cycle and primary cilia formation by hydroxylating the critical centrosome component CEP192 which promotes its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylates IKBKB, mediating NF-kappaB activation in hypoxic conditions. Target proteins are preferentially recognized via a LXXLAP motif.\n From UniProt JUN_HUMAN:\n Transcription factor that recognizes and binds to the enhancer heptamer motif 5\u0026rsquo;-TGA[CG]TCA-3\u0026rsquo; (PubMed:10995748, PubMed:22083952). Promotes activity of NR5A1 when phosphorylated by HIPK3 leading to increased steroidogenic gene expression upon cAMP signaling pathway stimulation (PubMed:17210646). Involved in activated KRAS-mediated transcriptional activation of USP28 in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells (PubMed:24623306). Binds to the USP28 promoter in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells (PubMed:24623306).\n Notes for tomorrow There were some genes that have way too many data points (see example below). I need to figure out what is causing this.

I then used a step-wise AIC feature selection method to optimize the model for each gene. I ran into a problem, however, in how to declare the intercept of the model. Originally, I had the WT allele set as the intercept, but this is irrelevant for the RNA expression feature. To further complicate matters, PAAD does not have enough WT KRAS cell lines, so the intercept was set to KRAS G12D. This is obviously not what we want to model\nTherefore, I have changed to a two-step process. First, I regress the depletion effect on the RNA expression of the target gene. The genes with a significant model (p \u0026lt; 0.01) are discorded. The second step is to run an ANOVA and conduct pair-wise T-tests.\nProblem: While doing this, I realized that LUAD only has enough cell lines (at least 3) for WT and G12C, but not G12V like there was before. I found that the problem was I specifically selected cell lines by their disease subtype containing \u0026ldquo;Adenocarcinoma\u0026rdquo;.
