Therefore, I wanted to create a simpler formulation to answer the question: If a sample was to have a KRAS mutation, what is the most likely one for it to get if decided by mutational signatures?\nMy formulation is as follows:\n for a tumor sample:  for each trinucleotide mutation $m$ with context $c$ that can cause a KRAS mutation:  calculate: $\\frac{|m|}{|c|}$  for each allele $a$:  $p(a) = \\sum{p(m)} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad m \\rightarrow a$  normalize such that ${A} \\Rightarrow \\sum^{A}{a} = 1$   This approach assumes that all codons are the same. If we were interested in only G12 mutations (the null hypothesis being that all G12 mutations are equal), then the same approach is followed again, but only normalizing the G12 mutations at the end.\nThe data I used was from GM:\n \u0026rdquo;/n/data1/hms/dbmi/park/gmelloni/cooc_mutex_driver/data/cbioportal/\u0026rdquo;:  \u0026ldquo;paad_luad_coadread_skcm_mm_tricLong_newAug2019.rds\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;context_and_signa_paad_luad_coadread_skcm_mm_NEW.rds\u0026rdquo;   It was prepared in \u0026ldquo;munge/50_trinucleotide-mutations.R\u0026rdquo;\nThe analysis was conducted in \u0026ldquo;src/50_10_observed-predicted-kras-alleles.R\u0026rdquo;.

(2018, PMID: 30199525) conducted an analysis of the frequency of KRAS alleles in different cancers, measuring the extent to which the alleles were distributed at random. They found that the alleles could not be explained by random chance, especially G12R in PAAD. Below is their abstract:\n A mutated KRAS protein is frequently observed in human cancers. Traditionally, the oncogenic properties of KRAS missense mutants at position 12 (G12X) have been considered as equal. Here, by assessing the probabilities of occurrence of all KRAS G12X mutations and KRAS dynamics we show that this assumption does not hold true. Instead, our findings revealed an outstanding mutational bias. We conducted a thorough mutational analysis of KRAS G12X mutations and assessed to what extent the observed mutation frequencies follow a random distribution. Unique tissue-specific frequencies are displayed with specific mutations, especially with G12R, which cannot be explained by random probabilities. To clarify the underlying causes for the nonrandom probabilities, we conducted extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations (170 μs) to study the differences of G12X mutations on a molecular level. The simulations revealed an allosteric hydrophobic signaling network in KRAS, and that protein dynamics is altered among the G12X mutants and as such differs from the wild-type and is mutation-specific. The shift in long-timescale conformational dynamics was confirmed with Markov state modeling. A G12X mutation was found to modify KRAS dynamics in an allosteric way, which is especially manifested in the switch regions that are responsible for the effector protein binding. The findings provide a basis to understand better the oncogenic properties of KRAS G12X mutants and the consequences of the observed nonrandom frequencies of specific G12X mutations.\n Below is an excerpt from the analysis of mutation frequencies. They used the ratio of transition to transversions to create their null distribution.\n We evaluated how random the occurrences of the specific G12X mutations are. To this end, we used the transition:transversion mutation ratio as a figure of merit, and compared this figure to a value of 2.3, which is the ratio for missense mutations observed in large-scale genomic analyses (34,35). If the mutations would take place randomly, G12D and G12S mutations should be the most abundant mutations as they are transition mutations (S2 Fig). G12D mutation is consistent with this view, as it occurs very often in all tissues. Meanwhile, G12S is not consistent with this behavior at all, as it occurs in tumors, perhaps surprisingly, very rarely. Also, regardless of the tissue type, the G12V mutation is over-expressed compared to values expected based on the assumption of random occurrences. Concluding, the mutations’ probabilities of occurrences are not consistent with a transition:transversion mutation ratio based on a random process.\n Supp. Fig. 2\nNew metric We want to plot observed vs. predicted frequency of the KRAS mutations; we need a new metric for predicted. The null is that the KRAS allele that each individual has was decided at random - the choice of KRAS allele was random and any would suffice. I need to figure out some measurement that calculates the predicted frequency of each allele given this null.\nNotes from meeting with KH  remove EGFR-activated mutants from KRAS WT in DepMap.

The minimum p-value I used is the one recommend by the WExT paper:\n We assume that there is a nonzero probability that a gene is mutated in a sample, and thus set [the weight to] $\\frac{1}{2N}$ when no mutation in gene $g_i$ is observed in sample $s_j$\u0026hellip;\n \u0026ndash; [\u0026ldquo;A weighted exact test for mutually exclusive mutations in cancer.\u0026rdquo; Leiserson et al., 2016]\nTherefore, the lowest p-values will be $\\frac{1}{2 \\times 10000}$.\nFollowing these changes, I re-ran all downstream analyses.\nNew exploratory plots I created a few more exploratory plots that help visualize the results from the RC test a bit better.\nThe first two below show the distribution of p-values from the RC-test and Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test.\nThe next plot shows the distribution of the effect size of the mutually exclusive interactions found with the RC-test.

I did meet with GM to go over a few things about his scripts and the figures, It went well and he seemed pleased with the current status and my proposed changes.\nBecause I couldn\u0026rsquo;t do any coding today, I took some time in the evening to brainstorm for the project. My thoughts are below.\nBrainstorming Fixing the last panel of Figure 2 One thing I want to change is the end of Figure 2. GM told me that the y-axis is not strictly the probability of getting the mutation. This is what Kevin, Peter, and I thought that it represented, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t according to GM. We want to show the observed frequency of the alleles compared to their predicted frequency based on the trinucleotide context. The reader should look at this plot, read the axes as \u0026ldquo;observed vs. predicted\u0026rdquo; and immediately have a strong understanding concept of what is shown. There is a paper that previously looked at this for the KRAS alleles; I should go see how they did the calculation.\nLogisitic regression for synthetic lethality I began working on logistic regression for the synthetic lethality - regressing on the KRAS allele with the gene effect as the predictor. I am still working on it, and it seems like a logical analysis to attempt. According to my notes from yesterday, my next attempt is to run a logistic regression on each allele vs. the rest.\nIn addition, I could try a logistic LASSO with a logistic regression on the KRAS alleles using all of the alleles as predictors. From a quick Google search, this seems like a good place to start: Penalized Logistic Regression Essentials in R: Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net.\nComparing overall dependencies of cell lines by KRAS alleles GM had a good idea during our meeting (credit where credit is due). He suggested looking at the overall distribution of lethal genes in the cell lines of each KRAS allele. I am picturing a \u0026lsquo;ggridges\u0026rsquo; plot, one for each allele. The thought was that perhaps \u0026ldquo;stronger\u0026rdquo; alleles will have fewer dependencies. The tricky part will be figuring out which genes to include. I should start by including all of the genes, though it is unlikely to show a difference between any of the alleles. I can also use information from the essential and nonessential genes. I would be interesting to just see the distributions for the \u0026ldquo;pan-essential\u0026rdquo; genes.\nOn a similar note, what about histograms for the genes in the KEGG pathways, CGC genes, and BioID genes? Normalize within a gene, and then show \u0026lsquo;ggridges\u0026rsquo; for the genes in each of those. Then, underneath, a heatmap of the most variable genes in the gene set showing their values in the cell lines. (I included a quick sketch in my notebook relating this thought.) I could also do this for any gene sets found to be enriched in the genes in the whole-cancer heatmap (not within individual clusters - they are too small), or with the gene sets found to be enriched in GSEA.\nA term for reduced comutation but not mutual exclusivity We need a different term than \u0026ldquo;mutually exclusive\u0026rdquo; when referring to genes that frequently mutate with a KRAS allele, just less often than would be predicted by random. The term \u0026ldquo;mutually exclusive\u0026rdquo; should be saved for BRAF and EGFR-like interactions, but not for TP53. However, I do not want to call it reduced comutation. (GM mentioned that I had used a good term a little while ago, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t recall it, I should look in the manuscript to see if it is there.) This is essential for the believability of the paper.\nFor plotting, we will want to come up with a heurisitc for separating between these three classes. Comutation and the others are easy, but between BRAF-like interactions and TP53-like interactions will be a bit trickier.\nComutation networks I need to use more stringent cutoffs for p-value, genetic events, and overall frequency of mutation before continuing further. I can also include supplemental plots for the distribution and cumulative distribution of these metrics.\nJake Lee (Park Lab) brought up the good idea of representing the comutation and reduced comutation genes using a canonical rainfall plot. My hesitation is because a lot of these events occur at low frequencies, the plot will be very sparse and unimpressive. For example, the PORCN comutation interaction with A146T in COAD is interesting because it is mutated in 3 or 4 of the A146T samples and about the same number of other samples. Just given the first value, the interaction seems uninteresting; the second value provides context. The ratio of these two values is the odds ratio, so perhaps somehow using that will increase the potency. Maybe a rainfall plot with the color representing the OR? If I can figure out a good plot for these interactions, then I can dive further into a few in particular to make some hypotheses (eg. what are the PORCN mutations?, are these likely disruptive?, are they located on the same part of the protein?, etc.)\nFor the rainfall plots, one tricky part will be deciding what genes to include. A few options are:\n For each allele, the genes with the most number of interactions. For each allele, the genes with the highest OR. Enriched gene sets across all of the hits. A priori selected gene sets.  I think this should give me plenty to work on, for now.\n","date":1571961600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571961600,"objectID":"1724bfb76f670def355820b69163cc3c","permalink":"https://project-notebook-comutation.netlify.com/post/2019-10-25/","publishdate":"2019-10-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-10-25/","section":"post","summary":"Meeting with GM I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any time to work on this project today.

Yesterday, I increased the stringency for the cutoffs by declaring the p-value threshold for the ANOVA across genes to be 0.01. This reduced the number of genes, as expected, but also made the heatmaps for believable and striking. I think it is the correct choice considering we cannot use an FDR adjusted cutoff in this case. The problem that I have run into now is that the functional enrichment does not turn out anything of remarkable interest for COAD and PAAD. LUAD still has quite a few hits, so I may be able to use those.\nMultinomial logistic regression Introduction I tried to use multinomial logistic regression to identify allele-specific synthetic lethality. The model regressed on the allele of the cell lines and used the gene effect as the covariate. This analysis was completed in \u0026ldquo;src/30_10_logisitic-regression-syn-let.R\u0026rdquo;.\nSources https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/multinomial-logistic-regression/\nThe model The model had the following form:\nallele ~ gene_effect  If available, \u0026ldquo;WT\u0026rdquo; was set as the baseline. Otherwise (for PAAD) the first allele alphabetically (G12D) was the intercept. The problem with this approach was that all of the comparisons were to the WT allele. This was even worse for PAAD where the comparison was to G12D.\nTherefore, I instead tried to run the same model but comparing each allele to the rest using a binomial (normal) logistic regression. I will have to do this tomorrow.\nI fixed an issue with the parsing of the gene names from depmap19Q3.Achilles.gene.dependency and depmap19Q3.Achilles.gene.effect. Gene names that normally have a hyphen instead had a period in their names. Therefore, they were split where there should have been a hyphen. This is unlikely to have a large effect on the results.\nI re-ran the downstream munging script \u0026ldquo;munge/15_depmap19Q3_model-data-prep.R\u0026rdquo;. I re-ran 10 and 30 group of scripts (linear modeling and logistic modeling).\n","date":1571875200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571875200,"objectID":"99f99dc1b2998742b48f338b304591c4","permalink":"https://project-notebook-comutation.netlify.com/post/2019-10-24/","publishdate":"2019-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-10-24/","section":"post","summary":"Allele-specific synthetic lethality I am revisiting the allele-specific synthetic lethality.

As noted in yesterday\u0026rsquo;s notebook, I have gathered the following gene lists:\n the following KEGG gene sets (from MSigDB) (a full list is available at the end of this notebook):  apoptosis, cell-cycle ERBB signaling pathway Hedgehog signaling pathway MAPK signaling pathway mTOR signaling pathway Notch signaling pathway p53 signaling pathway VEGF signaling pathway WNT signaling pathway  the interactors with WT KRAS from Kovalski et al., 2019 and the COSMIC Cancer Gene Consensus  The analysis was conducted in \u0026ldquo;src/20_43_apriori-lists-genetic-interactions.R\u0026rdquo;.\nDuring the analysis, I had to go back to \u0026ldquo;munge/30_rc-test_results-prep.R\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;src/20_35_rc-fisher-comparison.R\u0026rdquo; to fix some filtering mistakes. Their effects on the results were minor.\nThe resulting plots are shown below. For some of the LUAD and PAAD, I present separate plots for each source of gene list to keep the plot legible.\nCOAD LUAD KEGG pathways\nPhysical Interactors\nCGC Genes\nMM PAAD KEGG pathways\nPhysical Interactors\nCGC Genes\nA few comments  There are some genes that comutate with one allele and are mutually exclusive with another. This is something to look into. There are some obvious stand-outs in terms of how \u0026ldquo;strong\u0026rdquo; (low p-value) the interaction is. Again, these are likely worth further investigation.  Functional Enrichment Instead of using specific gene lists chosen for a priori reasons, I used a statistical tool to identify biological functions that are enriched in the list of genes identified to have a genetic interaction with a KRAS allele.\nErncihR The first attempt used the Enrichr (Chen et al., 2013) tool available through a R API using the \u0026lsquo;enrichR\u0026rsquo; package (link to the web API).\nThe following data bases were used:\n \u0026ldquo;BioCarta_2016\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;GO_Biological_Process_2018\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;KEA_2015\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;KEGG_2019_Human\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;LINCS_L1000_Kinase_Perturbations_down\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;LINCS_L1000_Kinase_Perturbations_up\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Panther_2016\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;PPI_Hub_Proteins\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Reactome_2016\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Transcription_Factor_PPIs\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;WikiPathways_2019_Human\u0026rdquo;  A complete list can be found using the following command in R.\nsort(enrichR::listEnrichrDbs()$libraryName)  The results were filtered by adjusted p-value \u0026lt; 0.20 and at least 2 genes in the gene set. The filtered tables were written to \u0026ldquo;tables/20_45_fxnal-enrich-genetic-interactions\u0026rdquo;.\nTODO\nThere is a bug where not all of the interactions are being included.

Therefore, it was difficult to read in and prepare as-is. I manually removed the annoying cells in a new file \u0026ldquo;Kovalski-et-al-2019_BioID_REFORMATTED.xlsx\u0026rdquo;\nThe resulting files are:\n cosmic_cgc_df kegg_geneset_df kras_interactors_bioid_df genes_of_interest_df (a collation of the genes and their sources)  Overlap Looking at each cancer, there is a good amount of overlap between the genetic interactions and the a priori genes of interest.\n   Cancer num. genes     COAD 108   LUAD 218   MM 15   PAAD 295    To see these genes in relation to each other, I imported the STRING pathway and selected just the proteins found in the overlap.\nThe STRING data base was downloaded on 2019-09-20 and all the original files are in my data base directory \u0026ldquo;/n/no_backup2/dbmi/park/jc604/databases/networks/STRING/\u0026ldquo;. The preparation was done in \u0026ldquo;munge/40_STRING-network-preparation.R\u0026rdquo;.\nDuring this analysis, I decided to stop because the computation was taking too long and the output was unlikely to be interesting. I will revisit this analysis, but I first want to deal with the zoomed-out view of comparing the results of the alleles.\nHigh-level genetic interaction figures This analysis was conducted in \u0026ldquo;src/20_40_highlivel-genetic-interactions.R\u0026rdquo;.\nI began work on the genetic interaction figures with the Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test used for comutation and the RC-test used for mutual exclusivity. I employed UpSet plots (using UpSetR) to visualize the overlap of the comutation and mutual exclusive interactions. As Joe stated, the UpSet plot is essentially a higher-dimensional Venn diagram.\n(The following plots do not have titles because there is no parameter for adding one in UpSetR\u0026hellip;)\nCOAD Comutation\nMutually Exclusive\nLUAD Comutation\nMutually Exclusive\nMM Comutation\nMutually Exclusive\nPAAD Comutation\nMutually Exclusive\nI also re-created the genetic interaction network plots. This time, however, I did not include the names all of genes, but instead use the plot to demonstrate higher-level trends.\nCOAD Many of the alleles are connected by shared mutually-exclusive interactions and have their own \u0026ldquo;clouds\u0026rdquo; of comutation interactions. This can be seen very clearly between G12D and G12V.\nInterestingly, Q61K and Q61L seem to be quite similar.\nLUAD There is a lot of overlap of mutually exclusive interactions between G12C and G12V. These alleles are both driven by smoke, but I can\u0026rsquo;t think of an explanation why this would drive mutual exclusivity.\nMM The allele-specific genetic interactions are very sparse, possibly speaking to the large distribution of KRAS alleles found in the diease. This may indicate that the allele is not as impactful in MM as it is in COAD, LUAD, and PAAD.\nThere are a few mutually exclusive partners shared by a few alleles.\nPAAD There are a lot of significant interactions here. Interestingly (worryingly?) I report here many(!) more comutation interactions than GM does in his figure even though we are use the same results. Even if I reduce the p-value cutoff to 0.01, I report at least an order of magnitude more interactions that GM. I definitely need to get to the bottom of this\u0026hellip;\nFinal notes  I need to look into why there is such a large discrepancy between my and GM\u0026rsquo;s figures, especially for PAAD. It appears that there are some genes that comutate with one allele and are mutually exclusive with another. These may be interesting to look further into. Not all of the alleles are appearing in the UpSet plots. I have added a note to the code to fix this.

This overlaps with \u0026ldquo;dependency\u0026rdquo; whereby the first mutation pushes the organism into a state of reliance on specific functions. Blocking (by mutation or inhibition) this function would cause the mutant organism to die, but not effect the wild-type organisms. Thus, much of current cancer therapy research is focused on finding synthetic lethal interactions with common oncogenes.\nAllele-specific synthetic lethality The goal of this portion of the Comutation project is to identify synthetic lethal interactions with specific KRAS alleles. From a theory point-of-view, these interactions would provide information on the differences between the alleles. From a therapeutics point-of-view, the identification of allele-specific interactions could be used to further personalize treatment strategies towards the pursuit of precision medicine.\nData For this analysis, we used the Cancer Dependency Mapping (DepMap) data. In this ongoing study, the cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) were analyzed in a genome-wide, CRISPR-Cas9, loss-of-function screen whereby each gene was systemically knocked-out and the loss of growth of the cell line was measured. Thankfully, many omics data are available for the cell lines, including RNA expression, mutations, and CNA.\n(Of note, there was an RNAi screen, though it was not as extensive as the CRISPR screen, and thus, was not used for this analysis.)\nResults Identification synthetic lethal interactions The first test employed searched for individual genes with allele-specific synthetic lethality. Any depletion effects of knocking-out a gene that could be explained by the gene\u0026rsquo;s own RNA expression were removed first, as this was likely the cause. Then, an ANOVA was used to find genes that had differential effects across cell lines when grouped by their KRAS allele.

Below the heatmaps are specific genes with strong allele-specific effects.\nCOAD\nLUAD\nBecause there are too many genes to show their names for LUAD, I identified enriched functions in the clusters.

Comutation would occur when the additional mutation enhances the growth phenotype of the tumor. And example of this would be KRAS, TP53, and CDKN2A in PAAD. On the other hand, another gene and KRAS would mutate in a mutually exclusive pattern because doing so leads to a reduction in growth. A very strong example of this is the mutually exclusive activation mutations in BRAF and KRAS.\nAnalysis Comutation To study comutation, we conducted a one-sided Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test for association between each KRAS allele and all other genes.\nMutual Exclusivity The Row-Column test for mutual exclusivity (the \u0026ldquo;RC-test\u0026rdquo;) was developed by the Raphael Lab in 2016 and described in A weighted exact test for mutually exclusive mutations in cancer (Leiserson et al., 2016). The software supplied with the paper searched for any groups of genes demonstrating mutually exclusive relationships, but took far too long to compute over all of our samples. Therefore, I implemented the RC-test in my own R package (in dev, WeXT) and used Snakemake to orchestrate the runs on O2 in parallel. Again, the test was run between each KRAS allele and all other genes.\nHigh-level visualization To provide a higher-level visualization of the results, the genetic interactions were displayed as a network. These are meant to be interpreted as \u0026ldquo;clouds\u0026rdquo; where the density of the cloud provides an idea of the number of interactions.\nI also created UpSet plots to show the size and overlap of the sets. These can be interpreted as high-dimensional Venn diagrams.\nAnalysis of biological properties of the genetic interactors I used a priori gene lists to identify any genes of interest that have detectable genetic interactions with the KRAS alleles. The lists were notable KEGG pathways, the physical interactors of KRAS from a BioID experiment conducted in Kovalski et al., 2019, and the COSMIC Cancer Gene Consensus.\nI also used Enrichr (Chen et al., 2013) to identify gene sets enriched in the interactors for each KRAS allele.\nResults The following figure shows the number of genes with a genetic interaction that was detected for each KRAS allele. For comutation, there had to be at least 3 comutation events to be included. For mutual exclusivity, the other gene had to be mutated at least 10 times in the cancer. For both tests, a p-value of 0.01 was used for the declaration of statistical significance.\nThe plot shows that the number of detectable interactions increases with the number of samples, as expected.\nThe plot below shows the distribution of number of mutually exclusive events by p-value of the association.\nThe rest of the summary is subdivided by cancer.\nCOAD\nLUAD\nMM\nPAAD\nCOAD Below are the high-level visualizations of the genetic interactions. The alleles tend to be connected by mutual exclusive interactions (instead of comutation interactions). Each allele also has their own set of comutation and mutually exclusive interactors.\nThe network below shows all of the interactions with genes in the a priori lists. As expected, BRAF is strongly mutually exclusive with many of the alleles and PIK3CA and APC comutate with several alleles, too. Surprisingly, G12D and G13D are mutually exclusive with TP53. A146T has two interesting comutation interactions with PORCN and MAP3K1. G12V has a very strong comutation interaction with SMAD4. G12C has a strong comutation interaction with RAPGEF2. G12S (bottom left) has a comutation interaction with SMAD3.\nThe KEGG pathway gene set was very informative. Notably, G13D was enriched for the mTOR pathway, including RICTOR as shown in the above network. The genes with interactions with G12D are enriched in adhesion pathways (\u0026ldquo;Regulation of actin cytoskeleton\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Focal adhesion\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Leukocyte TEM\u0026rdquo;), possibly linked to the enrichment for the Rap1 signaling pathway. Many of the alleles have interactions with genes involved in ERBB signaling.\nAlso of note, but not shown graphically here, the physical interactors of SMAD2, a transcription factor, were found to be enriched in the G12D genetic interactors by two different gene sets.\nA more direct visualization of the mutually exclusive and comutation interactions is via an oncoplot. On a heatmap, it shows a sample per column and a gene per row. The cell is filled with a color if the sample is mutated in the gene. The arrangement of the samples highlights the genetic interactions by showing either the overlap or exclusivity.\nI have shown them here for a select few of the alleles with interesting interactions. For the paper, a more selective portion of the interactions will be shown.\nLUAD Below are the high-level visualizations of the genetic interactions. The alleles tend to be connected by mutual exclusive interactions (instead of comutation interactions). This is especially true for G12C, G12V, and G12D. Each allele also has their own set of comutation and mutually exclusive interactors. There are many genes that are mutually exclusive with one allele and comutate with another.\nThe genetic interaction networks with genes in the a prior lists are divided in to the KEGG pathways (top) and the CGC (bottom). There are very strong mutually exclusive relationships between EGFR, BRAF, and TP53, as expected. Also, there is a strong comutation interaction between G12C and STK11. In the CGC network, it appears that G12C is mutually exclusive with CTNNB1 ($\\beta$-catenin). G12C also is mutually exclusive with three different genes involved in voltage-gated calcium channels. G12C is mutually exclusive with JAG2 and comutates with NOTCH1 suggesting a special relationship with the Notch signaling pathway. The three alleles linked to the smoking mutational signature, G12A/C/V, and Q61L have strong comutation interactions with ATM. There are several comutation interactions that are unexpected, namely between G12D and G12R with NKX2-1, Homeobox protein Nkx-2.1. This gene is a \u0026ldquo;transcription factor that binds and activates the promoter of thyroid specific genes,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;may play a role in lung development and surfactant homeostasis,\u0026rdquo; (UniProt P43699). Another interesting relationship is that KRAP1 comutates with G13D and G13C, but is mutually exclusive with G12V and G12C. This could indicate an codon-specific property of hyperactivated KRAS in LUAD.\nThe results of an enrichment analysis using a gene set of PPI hub proteins are shown first. The physical interactors with $\\beta$-catenin and SMARC4 are enriched in the interactors of G12C. The interactors of PKC-$\\alpha$ (gene PKRCA) are enriched in G12V genetic interactions. PKC-$\\alpha$ is a \u0026ldquo;calcium-activated, phospholipid- and diacylglycerol (DAG)-dependent serine/threonine-protein kinase that is involved in positive and negative regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, migration and adhesion, tumorigenesis, cardiac hypertrophy, angiogenesis, platelet function and inflammation, by directly phosphorylating targets such as RAF1, BCL2, CSPG4, TNNT2/CTNT, or activating signaling cascade involving MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2) and RAP1GAP,\u0026rdquo; (UniProt P17252).\nThe results of an enrichment analysis using a gene set of GO Biological Processes are shown below. G12A seems to have an enrichment for genes involved in P53-mediated cell cycle arrest. There are several Ras-related processes enriched in the G12C interactors.\nBelow are the oncoplots for the more common alleles in LUAD.\nMM Below are the high-level visualizations of the genetic interactions. There were not very many hits for multiple myeloma and very little overlap of the interacting genes between KRAS alleles.\nBelow is the network of genetic interactions for genes in the a priori lists. There is a detectable mutually exclusive interaction between Q61H and BRAF, though it is documented that MM can be highly multi-clonal. Therefore, there are often subpopulations of KRAS mutants and BRAF mutants within a single disease. This is likely true for KRAS and other genes, making the interpretation of these results difficult.\nThere was little evidence for functional enrichment in these genes.\nPAAD Below are the high-level visualizations of the genetic interactions. There were many allele-specific comutation and mutually exclusive interactions detected in PAAD. Further or more strict thresholds may be applied in future analyses to reduce false-positives.\nBelow are the interaction networks for genes in the a priori gene lists.\nThe first is of genes found to directly interact with KRAS in the CGC. Along with BRAF, there were some unexpected genes found to be mutually exclusive with multiple alleles. Interestingly, RNF43 was foound to be mutually exclusive with G12R, but comutates with G12D. RNF43 is \u0026ldquo;E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that acts as a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway by mediating the \u0026hellip; degradation of \u0026hellip; Frizzled,\u0026rdquo; (UniProt Q68DV7). In addition, TP53 is mutually exclusive with G12V, but comutates with Q61H and G12D. This is interesting because of the general perception that both KRAS and TP53 mutations are quintessential steps of PAAD progression. SMARCA4 is strongly mutually exclusive with G12R.\nThe following is the network of genetic interactions with genes found to directly interact with KRAS. One of the strongest interactions is between G12V and ATP2B1, the protein product of which helps regulate intracellular calcium levels at the plasma membrane. Another strong interaction is the mutually exclusive relationship between G12D and NF1. The obvious mechanism to propose for this is the same as that for BRAF.\nThe next genetic network is of the genes from select KEGG pathways. An interaction that really pops out is the strong comutation between Q61K and MAP3K13 and compared to the mutually exclusive relationships between G12V and G12R and the same gene. A similar case of conflicting interactions is found with MAP2K4 where it comutates with Q61R and is mutually exclusive with G12D. G12D strongly comutates with TGFBR2 - this transmembrane S/T-kinase activates SMAD2/4 when it binds with the cytokines TGFB1/2/3 (UniProt P37173). JAG2 is found to comutate with G12R, yet is mutually exclusive with G12V.\nTwo gene sets with interesting results from the enrichment analysis are shown below. The top is of kinases whose substrates are overrepresented in the associations, and the bottom is of Panther pathways.\nThere are a lot of substrates for the kinase PKA C-$\\alpha$ (gene PRKACA) that have genetic interactions with G12D and G12V. This kinase is involved in many cellular functions including Hedgehog and NF$\\kappa$B signaling. The substrates of Akt1 are also overrepresented in the genes with genetic interactions with G12D.\nMany genes involved in Wnt signaling have genetic interactions with several alleles. Genes of the EGFR pathway have many interactions with G12D.\nBelow are the oncoplots for the more interesting alleles in PAAD.\n","date":1570618689,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1570618689,"objectID":"696696eb53b5eb218f5299cab72e8b92","permalink":"https://project-notebook-comutation.netlify.com/project/comutation-and-mutual-exclusivity/","publishdate":"2019-10-09T06:58:09-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/comutation-and-mutual-exclusivity/","section":"project","summary":"Testing for genetic interactions in human tumor samples based on their mutational patterns.","tags":["comutation","KRAS"],"title":"Comutation and Mutual Exclusivity","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Finish preparing RC-test results The final step was to merge the actual mutation numbers for each gene to the results from the RC-test.\nThese new values were used to update the plots made in \u0026ldquo;20_30_rc-test-results-analysis.R\u0026rdquo; (also shown in the notebook for 2019-10-07).\nGeneral scope of results Below is the number of significant interactions (p-value \u0026lt; 0.05 and at-least 3 events) per cancer found by the RC-test.\nThe plot below separates the bars by the type of interaction.\nInteraction networks Munge Fisher\u0026rsquo;s test for comutation results To compare against the RC test, I prepared the results from GM\u0026rsquo;s test for comutation (a Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test).

The panel data could not be used for the RC-test because the test accounts for the total number of mutations in the sample.\nFrom these results, I propose that we use the Fisher\u0026rsquo;s test for comutation and RC-test for mutual exclusivity. This makes sense in so far as the RC-test was originally made for detecting mutual exclusivity and is equivalent (when comparing two genes) to the Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test for comutation as it approaches the limit.

I need to merge in the number of mutation events in order to remove the genetic interactions that do not meet a low standard. For comutation, there should be at least 2 co-mutation events. For mutual exclusivity, the other gene should be mutated in at least 0.01% of all the cancer\u0026rsquo;s samples. This will remove a lot of mutually exclusive events that are caused by the mutation just being very rare.\nI will then compare the results to those from the Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test:\n How many genes are shared by each allele between the two analyses (Venn diagram for each allele) For the shared genes, how do the p-values compare (scatter plot with x and y-axis as p-value from each analysis; a line for $y = x$)  Finally, I will look for interesting results in the significant genes. This will start with highlight CGC genes. Also those found from the BioID screen of KRAS and KRAS mutants. Lastly, I will use WebGestalt, EnrichR, or PANTHER (PMID: 23868073 for updated overview) to find functional patterns in the gene lists.\nFor the paper, I see the text reading something to the effect of, \u0026ldquo;X tended to comutate with KRAS A and B but no interaction was detected for KRAS C nor D,\u0026rdquo; for individual CGC genes.

Once I have completed that to a satisfactory degree, I will look for overlap between the hits from each analysis.\nAllele-specific synthetic lethality So far, I have only completed the simplest possible analysis to find allele-specific synthetic lethality. Briefly, I removed the genes that could be explained by their RNA expression. Then, I conducted an ANOVA and pair-wise comparisons to find differences in lethality between cells with the various KRAS alleles, including WT. Some of the most interesting results can be found on yesterday\u0026rsquo;s notebook, and all plots are available in \u0026ldquo;graphs/10_10_linear-modeling-syn-let_bosplots/\u0026ldquo;.\nI want a way of visualizing all of these results (especially for the meeting with KH and PJP). The obvious way is to produce a heatmap of patient vs. gene with the genes that were found to have a significant difference. Then, I could show specific box-plots for genes of interest (CGC, KRAS interactors from BioID screen, specific KEGG pathways).\nAnother approach could be to look for enriched biological processes/pathways. To this end, we could employ an analysis similar to GSEA. We could run GSEA as one KRAS allele against all other cell lines or just the KRAS WT cell lines. I will also look into GSVA and ssGSEA, two popular variants of GSEA.\nA quick analysis that could be very fruitful is to conduct a PCA on the gene-space and see if the cell lines cluster by KRAS allele. If they do, that would lend credence to our claim that the KRAS allele is important. (It may be useful to plot the first few PCs using tSNE or UMAP.) If there appear to be clusters, then some sort of clustering (K-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, spectral clustering, etc.) could be used to make the claim concrete. Even just a difference between KRAS and WT would be supportive of our claim.\nLASSO of KRAS WT vs mutant starting with all genes as covariates. Use the genes with non-trivial parameters in a random forest classifier or niave bayes classifier to predict the KRAS allele (including WT).\n","date":1570492800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1570492800,"objectID":"2baef37321172e099be496affdf38b48","permalink":"https://project-notebook-comutation.netlify.com/post/2019-10-08/","publishdate":"2019-10-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-10-08/","section":"post","summary":"Plan for analysis I did not have time to work on this project today, but I found time in the evening to think about how I want to progress.\nRC-test results analysis Tomorrow, I will focus on moving forward with analyzing the results from the RC-test.

Acts by forming a complex with phosphorylated PHF2, which mediates demethylation at Lys-336, leading to target the PHF2-ARID5B complex to target promoters, where PHF2 mediates demethylation of dimethylated \u0026lsquo;Lys-9\u0026rsquo; of histone H3 (H3K9me2), followed by transcription activation of target genes\u0026hellip; Required for adipogenesis: regulates triglyceride metabolism in adipocytes by regulating expression of adipogenic genes. Overexpression leads to induction of smooth muscle marker genes, suggesting that it may also act as a regulator of smooth muscle cell differentiation and proliferation.\n From UniProt SRP09_HUMAN:\n Signal-recognition-particle assembly has a crucial role in targeting secretory proteins to the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane. SRP9 together with SRP14 and the Alu portion of the SRP RNA, constitutes the elongation arrest domain of SRP. The complex of SRP9 and SRP14 is required for SRP RNA binding.\n LUAD From UniProt: STABP_HUMAN:\n Zinc metalloprotease that specifically cleaves \u0026lsquo;Lys-63\u0026rsquo;-linked polyubiquitin chains. Does not cleave \u0026lsquo;Lys-48\u0026rsquo;-linked polyubiquitin chains (By similarity). Plays a role in signal transduction for cell growth and MYC induction mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF. Potentiates BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) signaling by antagonizing the inhibitory action of SMAD6 and SMAD7. Has a key role in regulation of cell surface receptor-mediated endocytosis and ubiquitin-dependent sorting of receptors to lysosomes. Endosomal localization of STAMBP is required for efficient EGFR degradation but not for its internalization (By similarity). Involved in the negative regulation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR and RAS-MAP signaling pathways.\n PAAD From UniProt: EGLN2_HUMAN:\n Cellular oxygen sensor that catalyzes, under normoxic conditions, the post-translational formation of 4-hydroxyproline in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha proteins. Hydroxylates a specific proline found in each of the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domains (N-terminal, NODD, and C-terminal, CODD) of HIF1A. Also hydroxylates HIF2A\u0026hellip; Hydroxylated HIFs are then targeted for proteasomal degradation via the von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitination complex. Under hypoxic conditions, the hydroxylation reaction is attenuated allowing HIFs to escape degradation resulting in their translocation to the nucleus, heterodimerization with HIF1B, and increased expression of hypoxy-inducible genes. EGLN2 is involved in regulating hypoxia tolerance and apoptosis in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Also regulates susceptibility to normoxic oxidative neuronal death. Links oxygen sensing to cell cycle and primary cilia formation by hydroxylating the critical centrosome component CEP192 which promotes its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylates IKBKB, mediating NF-kappaB activation in hypoxic conditions. Target proteins are preferentially recognized via a LXXLAP motif.\n From UniProt JUN_HUMAN:\n Transcription factor that recognizes and binds to the enhancer heptamer motif 5\u0026rsquo;-TGA[CG]TCA-3\u0026rsquo; (PubMed:10995748, PubMed:22083952). Promotes activity of NR5A1 when phosphorylated by HIPK3 leading to increased steroidogenic gene expression upon cAMP signaling pathway stimulation (PubMed:17210646). Involved in activated KRAS-mediated transcriptional activation of USP28 in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells (PubMed:24623306). Binds to the USP28 promoter in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells (PubMed:24623306).\n Notes for tomorrow There were some genes that have way too many data points (see example below).

They cannot be used for the analysis.\nCell lines with a BRAF V600E or oncogenic NRAS mutation will be removed, too.\nA base data frame was created for the modeling data. Only the cell lines for the relevant cancers were kept. It has the KRAS mutation information for each cell line and two columns for whether the gene is noted as essential or nonessential by DepMap (NA if neither). This data frame was cached as \u0026ldquo;model_data_base\u0026rdquo;.\nOnly alleles with at least 3 cell lines can be considered for this analysis. Another data frame was created to reflect this.\n734 genes for 3 cell lines were NA in the raw data.

These data points were removed.\nNot all genes will be tested in the analysis because they do not exhibit a strong enough of a lethal effect. There were two criteria:\n a manual threshold of causing a depletion effect of -0.2 in at least two cell lines a metric based on a comparison of the scores in essential and non-essential genes  The threshold for the first criteria was two standard deviations above the mean of essential genes. The threshold for the second criteria was at the point where the distributions of the depletion effects of the essential and nonessential genes overlapped. By eye, these two cut-offs were fairly similar for each cancer. I should do an analysis of the effect of various cut-offs for the number of genes (added to TODO/Analyses/)\nRNA expression for each gene of each cell line was added as another column to the model data frame.\nAnother column was added to the model data frame called \u0026quot;is_altered\u0026quot;. It is true if there is a CNA or coding mutation in the cell line\u0026rsquo;s gene (else false).\nThis final data frame was saved as model_data_base where \u0026ldquo;base\u0026rdquo; denotes that it has all of the data to use for all of the models.\nAnother data frame was built from model_data_base that only has the data for KRAS alleles (including WT) that have at least 3 cell lines.

Therefore, I did not subtract 1 from the conversion. I also added a label for homozygous deletion (\u0026ldquo;homo_del\u0026rdquo;), heterozygous deletion (\u0026ldquo;het_del\u0026rdquo;), amplification (\u0026ldquo;amp\u0026rdquo;), or no change (\u0026ldquo;norm\u0026rdquo;).\nMutations The CCLE mutations were tidied up, though not much was needed.
