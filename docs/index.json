I need to merge in the number of mutation events in order to remove the genetic interactions that do not meet a low standard. For comutation, there should be at least 2 co-mutation events. For mutual exclusivity, the other gene should be mutated in at least 0.01% of all the cancer\u0026rsquo;s samples. This will remove a lot of mutually exclusive events that are caused by the mutation just being very rare.\nI will then compare the results to those from the Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test:\n How many genes are shared by each allele between the two analyses (Venn diagram for each allele) For the shared genes, how do the p-values compare (scatter plot with x and y-axis as p-value from each analysis; a line for $y = x$)  Finally, I will look for interesting results in the significant genes. This will start with highlight CGC genes. Also those found from the BioID screen of KRAS and KRAS mutants. Lastly, I will use WebGestalt, EnrichR, or PANTHER (PMID: 23868073 for updated overview) to find functional patterns in the gene lists.\nFor the paper, I see the text reading something to the effect of, \u0026ldquo;X tended to comutate with KRAS A and B but no interaction was detected for KRAS C nor D,\u0026rdquo; for individual CGC genes. Also, for any enriched biological processes, the text would look something like, \u0026ldquo;There was an enrichment for function Y in the genes found to comutate with KRAS E, potentially suggesting \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nHere is where I will stop until completing the synthetic lethal analysis. Once I have completed that to a satisfactory degree, I will look for overlap between the hits from each analysis.\nAllele-specific synthetic lethality So far, I have only completed the simplest possible analysis to find allele-specific synthetic lethality. Briefly, I removed the genes that could be explained by their RNA expression. Then, I conducted an ANOVA and pair-wise comparisons to find differences in lethality between cells with the various KRAS alleles, including WT. Some of the most interesting results can be found on yesterday\u0026rsquo;s notebook, and all plots are available in \u0026ldquo;graphs/10_10_linear-modeling-syn-let_bosplots/\u0026ldquo;.\nI want a way of visualizing all of these results (especially for the meeting with KH and PJP). The obvious way is to produce a heatmap of patient vs. gene with the genes that were found to have a significant difference. Then, I could show specific box-plots for genes of interest (CGC, KRAS interactors from BioID screen, specific KEGG pathways).\nAnother approach could be to look for enriched biological processes/pathways. To this end, we could employ an analysis similar to GSEA. We could run GSEA as one KRAS allele against all other cell lines or just the KRAS WT cell lines. I will also look into GSVA and ssGSEA, two popular variants of GSEA.\nA quick analysis that could be very fruitful is to conduct a PCA on the gene-space and see if the cell lines cluster by KRAS allele. If they do, that would lend credence to our claim that the KRAS allele is important. (It may be useful to plot the first few PCs using tSNE or UMAP.) If there appear to be clusters, then some sort of clustering (K-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, spectral clustering, etc.) could be used to make the claim concrete. Even just a difference between KRAS and WT would be supportive of our claim.\nLASSO of KRAS WT vs mutant starting with all genes as covariates. Use the genes with non-trivial parameters in a random forest classifier or niave bayes classifier to predict the KRAS allele (including WT).\n","date":1570492800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1570492800,"objectID":"2baef37321172e099be496affdf38b48","permalink":"https://project-notebook-comutation.netlify.com/post/2019-10-08/","publishdate":"2019-10-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-10-08/","section":"post","summary":"Plan for analysis I did not have time to work on this project today, but I found time in the evening to think about how I want to progress.\nRC-test results analysis Tomorrow, I will focus on moving forward with analyzing the results from the RC-test.

The benefit of this test is that it accounts for the number of mutations per sample in its estimate of significance. The main draw back is that it is permutation-based, and thus very slow.\nI was able to write a Snakemake script to run the test for all cancers and KRAS alleles. It has finally completed all of the tests and I will now port it over to this project. To move forward with the analysis, I will just port over the results and begin parsing. I will go back and move the files for running the analysis over in the future. For now, it is located on O2 at the following URL: \u0026ldquo;/n/data2/bidmc/medicine/haigis/Cook/KrasComutation/FinalAnalyses/RC_comutation_2/\u0026rdquo;\nMunging I copied the directory of the output of the RC-test into the data dir.\nmkdir data/rc-test-results cp -r ../KrasComutation/FinalAnalyses/RC_comutation_2/output/* data/rc-test-results  These files are automatically loaded into R by running load.project(). I combined all of the information into a single data frame, rc_test_results, in the munging script \u0026ldquo;30_rc-test_results-prep.R\u0026rdquo;. Here, I also extracted the non-KRAS gene from the gene_set column. The raw files were added to the list of raw data to ignore in \u0026ldquo;config/global.dcf\u0026rdquo;.\nAnalyzing RC-test results General scope of results Below is the number of significant interactions (p-value \u0026lt; 0.05 and at-least 3 events) per cancer found by the RC-test.\nThe plot below separates the bars by the type of interaction.\nInteraction networks Moving the RC-test directory to this project I got this far and decided that moving forward with any analysis would require a lot of the information from the RC-test directory. Therefore, I stopped and ported it over. The following are the steps I took.\nMoving input, intermediate, and output data mkdir data/rc-test mkdir data/rc-test/input data/rc-test/intermediate data/rc-test/output  cp ../KrasComutation/FinalAnalyses/RC_comutation_2/input/* data/rc-test/input/ cp ../KrasComutation/FinalAnalyses/RC_comutation_2/intermediate/* data/rc-test/intermediate/ cp -r ../KrasComutation/FinalAnalyses/RC_comutation_2/output/* data/rc-test/output/ cp -r ../KrasComutation/FinalAnalyses/RC_comutation_2/permuted_graphs data/rc-test/  Moving example DAG image cp ../KrasComutation/FinalAnalyses/RC_comutation_2/images/dag.pdf graphs/20_20_rc-test_Snakefile/  Moving scripts cp ../KrasComutation/FinalAnalyses/RC_comutation_2/Snakefile src/20_20_rc-test_Snakefile cp ../KrasComutation/FinalAnalyses/RC_comutation_2/snakemake_scripts/* src/ cp ../KrasComutation/FinalAnalyses/RC_comutation_2/prepare_input_tables.R src/ cp ../KrasComutation/FinalAnalyses/RC_comutation_2/generate_sm_output_names.R src cp ../KrasComutation/FinalAnalyses/RC_comutation_2/cluster.json config/  The snakemake scripts were renamed.

Below are some of the more interesting genes to pop out of the analysis.\nCOAD From UniProt ARI5B_HUMAN:\n Transcription coactivator that binds to the 5\u0026rsquo;-AATA[CT]-3\u0026rsquo; core sequence and plays a key role in adipogenesis and liver development. Acts by forming a complex with phosphorylated PHF2, which mediates demethylation at Lys-336, leading to target the PHF2-ARID5B complex to target promoters, where PHF2 mediates demethylation of dimethylated \u0026lsquo;Lys-9\u0026rsquo; of histone H3 (H3K9me2), followed by transcription activation of target genes\u0026hellip; Required for adipogenesis: regulates triglyceride metabolism in adipocytes by regulating expression of adipogenic genes. Overexpression leads to induction of smooth muscle marker genes, suggesting that it may also act as a regulator of smooth muscle cell differentiation and proliferation.\n From UniProt SRP09_HUMAN:\n Signal-recognition-particle assembly has a crucial role in targeting secretory proteins to the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane. SRP9 together with SRP14 and the Alu portion of the SRP RNA, constitutes the elongation arrest domain of SRP. The complex of SRP9 and SRP14 is required for SRP RNA binding.\n LUAD From UniProt: STABP_HUMAN:\n Zinc metalloprotease that specifically cleaves \u0026lsquo;Lys-63\u0026rsquo;-linked polyubiquitin chains. Does not cleave \u0026lsquo;Lys-48\u0026rsquo;-linked polyubiquitin chains (By similarity). Plays a role in signal transduction for cell growth and MYC induction mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF. Potentiates BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) signaling by antagonizing the inhibitory action of SMAD6 and SMAD7. Has a key role in regulation of cell surface receptor-mediated endocytosis and ubiquitin-dependent sorting of receptors to lysosomes. Endosomal localization of STAMBP is required for efficient EGFR degradation but not for its internalization (By similarity). Involved in the negative regulation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR and RAS-MAP signaling pathways.\n PAAD From UniProt: EGLN2_HUMAN:\n Cellular oxygen sensor that catalyzes, under normoxic conditions, the post-translational formation of 4-hydroxyproline in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha proteins. Hydroxylates a specific proline found in each of the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domains (N-terminal, NODD, and C-terminal, CODD) of HIF1A. Also hydroxylates HIF2A\u0026hellip; Hydroxylated HIFs are then targeted for proteasomal degradation via the von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitination complex. Under hypoxic conditions, the hydroxylation reaction is attenuated allowing HIFs to escape degradation resulting in their translocation to the nucleus, heterodimerization with HIF1B, and increased expression of hypoxy-inducible genes. EGLN2 is involved in regulating hypoxia tolerance and apoptosis in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Also regulates susceptibility to normoxic oxidative neuronal death. Links oxygen sensing to cell cycle and primary cilia formation by hydroxylating the critical centrosome component CEP192 which promotes its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylates IKBKB, mediating NF-kappaB activation in hypoxic conditions. Target proteins are preferentially recognized via a LXXLAP motif.\n From UniProt JUN_HUMAN:\n Transcription factor that recognizes and binds to the enhancer heptamer motif 5\u0026rsquo;-TGA[CG]TCA-3\u0026rsquo; (PubMed:10995748, PubMed:22083952). Promotes activity of NR5A1 when phosphorylated by HIPK3 leading to increased steroidogenic gene expression upon cAMP signaling pathway stimulation (PubMed:17210646). Involved in activated KRAS-mediated transcriptional activation of USP28 in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells (PubMed:24623306). Binds to the USP28 promoter in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells (PubMed:24623306).\n Notes for tomorrow There were some genes that have way too many data points (see example below). I need to figure out what is causing this.
