<h2 id="meeting-with-gm">Meeting with GM</h2>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have any time to work on this project today.
I did meet with GM to go over a few things about his scripts and the figures,
It went well and he seemed pleased with the current status and my proposed changes.</p>

<p>Because I couldn&rsquo;t do any coding today, I took some time in the evening to brainstorm for the project.
My thoughts are below.</p>

<h2 id="brainstorming">Brainstorming</h2>

<h3 id="fixing-the-last-panel-of-figure-2">Fixing the last panel of Figure 2</h3>

<p>One thing I want to change is the end of Figure 2.
GM told me that the y-axis is not strictly the probability of getting the mutation.
This is what Kevin, Peter, and I thought that it represented, but it doesn&rsquo;t according to GM.
<em>We want to show the observed frequency of the alleles compared to their predicted frequency based on the trinucleotide context.</em>
The reader should look at this plot, read the axes as &ldquo;observed vs. predicted&rdquo; and immediately have a strong understanding concept of what is shown.
There is a paper that previously looked at this for the <em>KRAS</em> alleles; I should go see how they did the calculation.</p>

<h3 id="logisitic-regression-for-synthetic-lethality">Logisitic regression for synthetic lethality</h3>

<p>I began working on logistic regression for the synthetic lethality - regressing on the <em>KRAS</em> allele with the gene effect as the predictor.
I am still working on it, and it seems like a logical analysis to attempt.
According to my notes from yesterday, my next attempt is to run a logistic regression on each allele vs. the rest.</p>

<p>In addition, I could try a logistic LASSO with a logistic regression on the <em>KRAS</em> alleles using <em>all</em> of the alleles as predictors.
From a quick Google search, this seems like a good place to start: <a href="http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/36-classification-methods-essentials/149-penalized-logistic-regression-essentials-in-r-ridge-lasso-and-elastic-net/" target="_blank"><em>Penalized Logistic Regression Essentials in R: Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net</em></a>.</p>

<h3 id="comparing-overall-dependencies-of-cell-lines-by-kras-alleles">Comparing overall dependencies of cell lines by <em>KRAS</em> alleles</h3>

<p>GM had a good idea during our meeting (credit where credit is due).
He suggested looking at the overall distribution of lethal genes in the cell lines of each <em>KRAS</em> allele.
I am picturing a <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/index.html" target="_blank">&lsquo;ggridges&rsquo;</a> plot, one for each allele.
The thought was that perhaps &ldquo;stronger&rdquo; alleles will have fewer dependencies.
The tricky part will be figuring out which genes to include.
I should start by including all of the genes, though it is unlikely to show a difference between any of the alleles.
I can also use information from the essential and nonessential genes.
I would be interesting to just see the distributions for the &ldquo;pan-essential&rdquo; genes.</p>

<p>On a similar note, what about histograms for the genes in the KEGG pathways, CGC genes, and BioID genes?
Normalize within a gene, and then show &lsquo;ggridges&rsquo; for the genes in each of those.
Then, underneath, a heatmap of the most variable genes in the gene set showing their values in the cell lines.
(I included a quick sketch in my notebook relating this thought.)
I could also do this for any gene sets found to be enriched in the genes in the whole-cancer heatmap (not within individual clusters - they are too small), or with the gene sets found to be enriched in GSEA.</p>

<h3 id="a-term-for-reduced-comutation-but-not-mutual-exclusivity">A term for reduced comutation but not mutual exclusivity</h3>

<p><strong>We need a different term than &ldquo;mutually exclusive&rdquo; when referring to genes that frequently mutate with a <em>KRAS</em> allele, just less often than would be predicted by random.</strong>
The term &ldquo;mutually exclusive&rdquo; should be saved for <em>BRAF</em> and <em>EGFR</em>-like interactions, but not for <em>TP53</em>.
However, I do not want to call it <em>reduced</em> comutation.
(GM mentioned that I had used a good term a little while ago, but couldn&rsquo;t recall it, I should look in the manuscript to see if it is there.)
This is essential for the believability of the paper.</p>

<p>For plotting, we will want to come up with a heurisitc for separating between these three classes.
Comutation and the others are easy, but between <em>BRAF</em>-like interactions and <em>TP53</em>-like interactions will be a bit trickier.</p>

<h3 id="comutation-networks">Comutation networks</h3>

<p>I need to use more stringent cutoffs for p-value, genetic events, and overall frequency of mutation before continuing further.
I can also include supplemental plots for the distribution and cumulative distribution of these metrics.</p>

<p>Jake Lee (Park Lab) brought up the good idea of representing the comutation and reduced comutation genes using a canonical rainfall plot.
My hesitation is because a lot of these events occur at low frequencies, the plot will be very sparse and unimpressive.
For example, the <em>PORCN</em> comutation interaction with <em>A146T</em> in COAD is interesting because it is mutated in 3 or 4 of the A146T samples and about the same number of other samples.
Just given the first value, the interaction seems uninteresting; the second value provides context.
The ratio of these two values is the odds ratio, so perhaps somehow using that will increase the potency.
Maybe a rainfall plot with the color representing the OR?
If I can figure out a good plot for these interactions, then I can dive further into a few in particular to make some hypotheses (eg. what are the <em>PORCN</em> mutations?, are these likely disruptive?, are they located on the same  part of the protein?, etc.)</p>

<p>For the rainfall plots, one tricky part will be deciding what genes to include.
A few options are:</p>

<ol>
<li>For each allele, the genes with the most number of interactions.</li>
<li>For each allele, the genes with the highest OR.</li>
<li>Enriched gene sets across all of the hits.</li>
<li><em>A priori</em> selected gene sets.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>I think this should give me plenty to work on, for now.</p>
