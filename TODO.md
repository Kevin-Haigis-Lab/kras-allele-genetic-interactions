2. Mock-up figures
3. Write

## Analyses

- Fix Figure 2 final panel
    + it is supposed to show observed vs. predicted for the KRAS allele frequency
    + it currently shows some strange calculations from GM that I do not understand nor can explain
    + it needs to be something easily interpretable
- general descriptive plots for the cell lines from DepMap
- overlap between hits from comutation and synthetic lethal
- rainfall plots for comutation interactions in *a priori* lists
- look into specific genes with genetic interactions
    + what other plots are available from 'maftools'?
    + TP53 type of mutations for claims of reduced comutation (are the mutations that do occur considered the hotspots?)
- functional enrichment from genetic interactions
- are any of the syn. let. hits classified as pan-nonessential or pan-essential?
    + do any of them *become* lethal in an allele?
- Functional enrichment of synthetic lethal hits
    + run for all hits in a cancer (will be included in the text)
    + add cluster number of cluster functional enrichment
