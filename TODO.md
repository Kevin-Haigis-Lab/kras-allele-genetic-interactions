		* then add the raw to ignore
	* munging of GM co-mutation results
	* split the main analysis up into multiple scripts
		* some will also be moved to munging
2. an analysis script to look into how these cutoffs effect the data

## Easy Wins



## Today

Organizing the re-doing of the synthetic lethal analysis:

1. finish preparing the data for modeling
2. read up on some of the R package for modeling:
    - 'rms'
    - 'lme4'
    - 'glm'
    - 'lavaan' (tutorial provided)
3. design architecture for the analysis
    - account for multiple types of models and comparing them
