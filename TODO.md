## Papers to read



## Munging




## Doc

* add logs and test output to website


## Analyses

- Fix Figure 2 final panel
    + it is supposed to show observed vs. predicted for the KRAS allele frequency
    + it currently shows some strange calculations from GM that I do not understand nor can explain
    + it needs to be something easily interpretable
- compare overall dependencies of the cell lines by KRAS alleles
- what mutations are shared by each cell line?
    + general descriptive plots for the cell lines
- overlap between hits from comutation and synthetic lethal
- specify therapeutically viable genes from synthetic lethal hits
- rainfall plots for comutation interactions in *a priori* lists
- look into specific genes with genetic interactions
    + what other plots are available from 'maftools'?
    + TP53 type of mutations for claims of reduced comutation (are the mutations that do occur considered the hotspots?)
- functional enrichment from genetic interactions

## Fixes

- Problem with oncoplots in PAAD
    + G12R in both G12R and other KRAS mutants
    + WT was thrown into other


## Questions

1. Should I exclude EGFR mutants from LUAD *KRAS* WT?
